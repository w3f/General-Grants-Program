# How to Host a Polkadot Meetup

We are appreciative of the willingness of our community to step forward to host meetups so have assembled this guide in order to make it easier to others considering starting or taking over an already established Polkadot group.


## Scoping Phase

When thinking about launching your own Polkadot group, the following questions might be considered:

1. What values does your meetup represent? For example, localism, collaboration, social, participant driven, large scale and far reaching.

2. Who is the target audience? Non-technical users, beginners, advanced developers etc.

3. What specifically do you want your audience to learn about? 

4. How are you going to provide variety of content and a stimulating learning environment?

5. What format will the meetup take? Fireside chat, lightning pitches, panel discussions, debating, presentations…

6. How regularly do you plan on hosting your meetup?

7. Who can support you and make up the local leadership team?

8. Are there any key takeaways from other meetups that can help you plan your own?


**We would recommend**:

Attend plenty of meetups in preparation and connect with others who have the appetite and capacity to co-organise the meetup with you. You may want to go through the above list during the scoping phase of your planning. 


## Role and Responsibilities

Meetups often require too much logistical and operational input for one single individual. Allocation of clear roles and responsibilities will help facilitate a smooth event that is easy to replicate in the future. We recommend distributing the organisational responsibilities so that the success of the meetup doesn’t depend on a single individual and instead is spread across the following roles:

1. Lead Coordinator
2. Event Marketing 
3. Venue Scout
4. Master of Ceremonies
5. Finance and Sponsorship
6. Swag, Food and Drink
7. Communications before, during and after 
8. Meetup Group and managing members 


## Requirements

Now that you’ve assembled a local leadership team to host meetups, in addition there are some other preconditions that need to be set before you can launch a meetup.

1. A process for proposing and approving meetups. Say for example a member of the group or one of the local leaders makes a suggestion for what the next meetup should be. How does this get approved? 
2. Now that you have a proposed meetup, you need a group to host it through. Web3 Foundation may be able to sponsor your group, fill out this [application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-hbgzMHkwYLCy9-0NLmnpIJdD-nwq_vqNwba9JiiKFmZmZg/viewform) to enquire.
3. Social media accounts (Twitter at least) in order to promote the group and the event at least four weeks in advance of you event.
4. A way of issuing tickets and tracking attendance (Meetup and/or Eventbrite).
5. Sponsorship - meetup costs can escalate, particularly for larger events where venue hire, food and drink and live streaming are involved.


## Sponsorship

Given you’ll be investing your own time and effort into your meetup, we would recommend finding local sponsors to alleviate the financial burden. Sponsors can help with overheads such as food, drink and the venue.

In some cases, Web3 Foundation will provide organisers with financial support either on a one off or an ongoing basis. In order to make an enquiry about the eligibility of your group, please kindly fill out and submit this application.

## Organising Speakers
Finding talented speakers for presentations, moderators for panels and master of ceremonies for more interactive meetups is the key to making your event a success. Most of the other organisation comes secondary and is planned around when your first choice speakers are able to present. Providing your audience with a variety of content at each event is important instead of focusing on the same topic repeatedly.


## Save The Date

Now that you have your speakers in mind, you’ll need to go firm on a date. When thinking about the date:

* Try to avoid hosting a meetup if similar events are taking place on the same day and in the same location.
* Whilst it can help to pick up numbers by hosting around a related conference, we feel that meetups are local community driven initiatives and are not purely a numbers game.
* We find that members prefer to attend meetups when their dairies are more open in the first half of the week Monday to Wednesday. 


## Finding A Venue

Finding the right venue for your meetup can be a significant challenge. The most popular venues tend to book months in advance, the bigger venues often come with a large cost. Finding central venues that are easy to get to may not have the desired look and feel for the meetup. We have tended to find that co-working spaces are open to hosting community driven events and often are able to offer more competitive prices. But it is great to offer your members a variety otherwise the meetup will feel the same every time. So don’t be afraid of renting some unconventional spaces such as clubs, boats, pubs, theatres, art galleries - assuming you can secure at a competitive rate or better still for free! 

Remember to leave enough time on the night to put up signage to help your members navigate to the right floor or room for the meetup.



## Publishing Your Meetup
Now that you have your planning phase complete, you need to focus on publishing and marketing:

1. Start a ‘Polkadot - Your City’ group, see for example [Polkadot - Berlin](https://www.meetup.com/Polkadot-Berlin/)
2. Draft some text on what your group is about in the ‘What Were About’ section
3. If there is already a ‘Polkadot - Your City’ group, contact the organizers for assistance and tell them about your planned event.
4. Draft a detailed outline of your event for the Event Page, aiming to be as informative as possible about your speakers and their topic in order to attract your audience.
5. Publish your event on meetup.com (Yay!)
6. Spread the word for your meetup on Twitter
7. Aim to cross market to other similar groups. Reach out to their organisers and ask them to tweet about your event.

## Polkadot Community Issue

To keep the community up to date with your meetup plans and for attracting new members, co-organisers etc, we recommend opening a new issue in Polkadot/Community. 

Within the issue if you can let us know the following:

1. Rationale for the meetup, why it is a good idea to host one then
2. What presentation resources, slides etc you require from the Web3 Foundation
3. To reach out directly to the Community Team at Web3 Foundation, complete the following application


## On The Day

1. Make sure you allow plenty of time to get to the venue
1. Get there sufficiently far in advance so that you can:
   1. Test the Audio/Visual equipment
   1. Put up signs for directions
   1. Prepare the food and drink
   1. Set up the space
   1. Make sure the speakers have water or their preferred beverage ready
   1. Check the lighting arrangements for the videographer
   1. Test the wifi connection and make sure you can access the WiFi reserved for the venue staff and not the audience
   1. Sound check all of the microphones
3. Prepare the merchandise and swag, ready for the arrival of the members


## Brief The Speakers In Advance

1. Ensure the speakers are aware of their time allowance
2. Brief the Master of Ceremonies on the cut off times 
3. Let the speakers know the order they are speaking in or how they will arranged on a panel

## At The Start of the Event

1. Welcome the audience and brief them on the order of the event, start and finish times etc.
2. If appropriate, let the audience know that you are looking to build out a local leadership team and are looking for volunteers.
3. Remind the audience to tweet about the event and display the appropriate social channels

## Throughout the Event

1. Live Tweet throughout the event, with pictures and quotes from the speakers
2. Take lots of pictures for the meetup.com group 
3. Generally make sure your members are enjoying themselves
4. Enjoy yourself!

## After the Event

1. Request some direct feedback from people you met and from the group. Make sure you follow up with anyone who gets in touch or refer them to Web3 Foundation.
2. Hold a ‘post mortem’ call or meeting with all the organisers and if possible any attendees to discuss what could be improved, what went well, in order to refine the process of delivering meetups in the future.
3. The Event Host should draft a review of the event within two weeks of the event and post in the Polkadot Community Issue. This could also make for some interesting content for the Polkadot Communications team in general for a medium post etc.
4. Finally, submit the final budget in the Polkadot Community Issue and, where applicable, directly to the Web3 Foundation. This will be useful information for future organisers in your region.
