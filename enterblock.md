## Project Description
* Abstract
  * Our goal is to provide Substrate-based blockchains for users (mainly companies) to easily access.
We will provide APIs and documents basically so that they can be applied quickly and easily in applying blockchain to companies, and we will be able to easily exchange assets (tokens, copyrights, SCM information, etc.) in Polka dot chain.
We have already developed these projects through Parity, and we want to integrate them to develop them.

* Introduction
  * BaaS, which means blockchain as a service, can provide a blockchain service suitable for the environment even if the company preparing the blockchain service does not know blockchain technology. Compared with general nodes, the purpose of BaaS nodes is to quickly build the development environment that they mainly need, and provide various other services such as blockchain-based data inquiry, transaction transmission, and data analysis. It helps developers quickly validate their concepts and models. Even without a specialized blockchain development manpower, it is possible to construct a blockchain node with a few clicks and implement a smart contract, a core technology of the blockchain. Since there is no need to build a separate server, a company that wants to introduce a blockchain service can dramatically reduce the cost and time for service development.

## Development Roadmap

For each milestone:
* Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of detail must be enough so that we are able to test that the software meets the specification.
* Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone. Funding can be in fiat (CHF, EUR or USD) or in DOTs. It can also be in a combination of fiat and DOTs. Please reach out to grants@web3.foundation (http://grants@web3.foundation/) to discuss what amount in fiat and DOTs would be appropriate for your project.
* Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* Please commit to providing a docker container for the delivery of your project. 
* Please indicate the number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.
