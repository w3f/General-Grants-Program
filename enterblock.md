## Project Description
* Abstract
  * Our goal is to provide Substrate-based blockchains for users (mainly companies) to easily access.
We will provide APIs and documents basically so that they can be applied quickly and easily in applying blockchain to companies, and we will be able to easily exchange assets (tokens, copyrights, SCM information, etc.) in Polka dot chain.
We have already developed these projects through Parity, and we want to integrate them to develop them.

* Introduction
  * BaaS, which means blockchain as a service, can provide a blockchain service suitable for the environment even if the company preparing the blockchain service does not know blockchain technology. Compared with general nodes, the purpose of BaaS nodes is to quickly build the development environment that companies mainly need, and provide various other services such as blockchain-based data inquiry, transaction transmission, and data analysis. It helps developers quickly validate their concepts and models. Even without a specialized blockchain development manpower, it is possible to construct blockchain nodes with a few clicks and implement smart contracts and core technologies of the blockchain. Since there is no need to build separate servers, companies that want to introduce a blockchain service can dramatically reduce the cost and time for service development. Currently, there are many service-type blockchain providers, and more companies are entering the market every year. In particular, there are some very reliable companies(Miscrosoft, Blockstream, Deloitte, Amazon and Dragonchain) that have already started offering these services to their customers. Unlike the above companies, enterBlock's enterprise-type BaaS utilizes Polkadot's interoperability, scalability, forkless future proof, and full security advantages to build blockchains based on the simple substrate framework in a matter of minutes. 

* Brief Explanation for the enterBlock BaaS Architecture
  * The enterprise block chain BaaS provided by enterBlock can provide various types of services as shown in the figure above. For example, if a general financial company wants to build a blockchain for their service operation, it can be easily built through our enterBlock platform. If they want to put their desired business logic on the blockchain, enterBlock can easily provide their desired logic in the form of API using pallets provided by substrate. Also, if you want to bring financial data from outside, you can easily meet their requirements by using offchain workers. Each blockchain in enterBlock can communicate with each other and exchange assets and data. The conclusion is that for each company, a blockchain suitable for the desired business logic is possible in enterBlock.

## Development Roadmap

For each milestone:
* Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of detail must be enough so that we are able to test that the software meets the specification.
* Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone. Funding can be in fiat (CHF, EUR or USD) or in DOTs. It can also be in a combination of fiat and DOTs. Please reach out to grants@web3.foundation (http://grants@web3.foundation/) to discuss what amount in fiat and DOTs would be appropriate for your project.
* Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* Please commit to providing a docker container for the delivery of your project. 
* Please indicate the number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.
