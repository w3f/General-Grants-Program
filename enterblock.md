## Project Description
* Abstract
  * First goal : Providing Substrate-based blockchains(BaaS solutions) for users (mainly companies) to easily access.
  * Second goal : Many clients sometimes want to use our BaaS system as well as services related to many other parachains in the Polkadot ecosystem. In this situation, through the relay nodes that we operate, clients can easily use APIs without knowing the structure of many other parachains in the Polkadot ecosystem.
  
We will provide common APIs and documents basically so that they can be applied quickly and easily in applying blockchain to companies.
We have already developed these projects through Parity, and we want to integrate them to develop them.

* Introduction
  * BaaS, which means blockchain as a service, can provide a blockchain service suitable for the environment even if the company preparing the blockchain service does not know blockchain technology. Compared with general nodes, the purpose of BaaS nodes is to quickly build the development environment that companies mainly need, and provide various other services such as blockchain-based data inquiry, transaction transmission, and data analysis. It helps developers quickly validate their concepts and models. Even without a specialized blockchain development manpower, it is possible to construct blockchain nodes with a few clicks and implement smart contracts and core technologies of the blockchain. Since there is no need to build separate servers, companies that want to introduce a blockchain service can dramatically reduce the cost and time for service development. Currently, there are many service-type blockchain providers, and more companies are entering the market every year. In particular, there are some very reliable companies(Miscrosoft, Blockstream, Deloitte, Amazon and Dragonchain) that have already started offering these services to their customers. Unlike the above companies, enterBlock's enterprise-type BaaS utilizes Polkadot's interoperability, scalability, forkless future proof, and full security advantages to build blockchains based on the simple substrate framework in a matter of minutes. 

* Brief Explanation for the enterBlock BaaS Architecture
  * The enterprise block chain BaaS provided by enterBlock can provide various types of services as shown in the figure above. For example, if a general financial company wants to build a blockchain for their service operation, it can be easily built through our enterBlock platform. If they want to put their desired business logic on the blockchain, enterBlock can easily provide their desired logic in the form of API using pallets provided by substrate. Also, if you want to bring financial data from outside, you can easily meet their requirements by using offchain workers. Each blockchain in enterBlock can communicate with each other and exchange assets and data. The conclusion is that for each company, a blockchain suitable for the desired business logic is possible in enterBlock.
  
* Expectations
  * enterBlock's Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) makes it easy for anyone from passionate startups and large enterprises to create blockchain applications. This is possible by creating a blockchain-based product and eliminating a lot of technical complexity. Most of the creation, implementation, and maintenance of an operational blockchain infrastructure no longer needs to be built from scratch. As banks and traditional financial institutions invest in blockchain with many companies in various industries, the chances of a blockchain provider as a service are very successful. BaaS services are particularly useful for startups that lack funds and talent, which are barriers to entry for blockchain innovation. Digital transformation is currently the biggest trend in the financial sector. In the current situation where tech fin companies are rapidly entering, financial sectors, including banks, will also be difficult to survive without disruptive innovation. Therefore, it is judged that traditional financial institutions, including banks, will utilize the blockchain provided by enterBlock, which can easily build and manage blockchains in financial services. On the basis of enterBlock BaaS, it is expected that the financial system can obtain an unprecedented cost reduction through blockchain. In the current centralized system, central security that stores all transaction records and personal information is very important. Financial fraudsters constantly develop all kinds of new technologies to paralyze this security system. So, financial companies are investing enormous costs in the technology to defend them. As e-commerce expands more and the Internet of Things (IoT) eras transactions between objects, costs are bound to rise. enterBlock is expected to grow as a breakthrough company in the enterprise-type BaaS market by solving the above problems for companies in preparation for such a market.

* enterBlock Projects in progress based on Substrate
  * GlueOS : It is a blockchain project that provides a development-friendly environment, and is a blockchain project focused on increasing developer convenience and providing the same user experience as a web and mobile environment. Therefore, general developers can easily participate in blockchain-based service development through glue.
