# Project name

## Project Overview
If this application in response to an RFP then please indicate this on the first line of this section.

Please provide the following:
  * A brief description of the project.
  * An indication of why this project is good for the ecosystem.
  * An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot.
  * An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
  
## Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.

Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
* Mockups/designs of any UI components
* API specifications of the core functionality
* An overview of the technology stack to be used 
* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture etc. to be deployed
* MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

## Ecosystem Fit 
Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?

## Team members
* Name of team leader
* Names of team members	

## Team Website	
* https://...

## Legal Structure 
Please provide the name and registered address of the legal entity executing the project. These details can also be shared privately via the Google Form used for your application.

## Team's experience
Please describe the team's relevant experience.  If the project involves development work, then we'd appreciated if you can single out a few interesting code commits made by team members on their past projects.  We'll glance at whole repositories too, but not if they contain many vendored dependencies, which often makes commits easier.

## Development Roadmap
This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to have as much detail as possible. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Here is a reminder of the main criteria of our grants:
* Focus on Substrate / Polkadot related projects.
* Max $100k.
* Timeframe: up to 3 months is ideal.
* Open source license (the preferred license is Apache 2.0)

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate and/or Polkadot. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone. It is always best to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product.

For each milestone:
* Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of detail must be enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
* Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone. Funding can be in fiat (CHF, EUR or USD) or in DOTs. It can also be in a combination of fiat and DOTs. Please reach out to grants@web3.foundation to discuss what amount in fiat and DOTs would be appropriate for your project.
* Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
* Please commit to providing a docker container for the delivery of your project. 
* Please indicate the number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.

### Milestone 1 — Implement Substrate Modules — 1 month — $10,000
* We will create a Substrate module that will... (Please list the functions that will be coded for the first milestone).
* We will deliver a working module, along with a simple tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works.
* The code will have proper unit-test coverage to ensure functionality and robustness.
* We will build a Docker image with (e.g.) our Substrate chain, demonstrating its functionality.
* We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial describing how the software can be used and tested.

### Milestone 2 — Additional features — 1 month — $10,000
* We will create a... (Describe the next round of features and functions that will be added).
* We will deliver... (Explain how you will demonstrate that the functionality you built will work as intended).
* The code will have proper unit-test coverage to ensure functionality and robustness.
* We will build a Docker image with (e.g.) our Substrate chain, demonstrating its functionality.
* We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial describing how the software can be used and tested.

### Milestone 3 — Additional features — 1 month — $10,000
* We will create a... (Describe the next round of features and functions that will be added).
* We will deliver... (Explain how you will demonstrate that the functionality you built will work as intended).
