# General Grant Proposal

* **Project:** The name of the project

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application in response to an RFP then please indicate this on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

* A brief description of the project.
* An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.
* An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.

Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

* Mockups/designs of any UI components
* API specifications of the core functionality
* An overview of the technology stack to be used
* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture etc. to be deployed
* PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

### Ecosystem Fit

Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?

## Team :busts_in_silhouette:

### Team members

* Name of team leader
* Names of team members 

### Team Website 

* https://<your_domain>

### Legal Structure

Please provide the name and registered address of the legal entity executing the project. When applying via the General Grants program, these details can also be shared privately via the Google Form used for your application.

### Team's experience

Please describe the team's relevant experience.  If the project involves development work, we'd appreciated if you singled out a few interesting projects or contributions made by team members in the past. For research-related grants, references to past publications and projects in a related domain are helpful.

### Team Code Repos

* https://github.com/<your_organisation>/<project_1>
* https://github.com/<your_organisation>/<project_2>

Please also provide the GitHub accounts of all team members. If they contain no activity, references to projects hosted elsewhere or live are also fine.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate and/or Polkadot. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone.

For each milestone:

* make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program/blob/master/src/grant_guidelines_per_category.md).
* include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
* include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
* commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
* indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
* **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

* **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
* **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
* **Total Costs:** Amount of payment in fiat for the whole project. The total amount of funding needs to be below $100k. (e.g. 12,000 USD). This and the costs for each milestone need to be in fiat; if the grant is paid out in cryptocurrency, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement Substrate Modules

* **Estimated duration:** 1 month
* **FTE:**  2
* **Costs:** 8,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / GPLv3 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes and send test transactions, which will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 0e. | Article | We will publish an **article**/workshop that explains [...] (what was done/achieved as part of the grant). (Content, language and medium should reflect your target audience described above.) |
| 1. | Substrate module: X | We will create a Substrate module that will... (Please list the functionality that will be implemented for the first milestone) |  
| 2. | Substrate module: Y | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 3. | Substrate module: Z | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 4. | Substrate chain | Modules X, Y & Z of our custom chain will interact in such a way... (Please describe the deliverable here as detailed as possible) |  

### Milestone 2 Example — Additional features

...

### Community engagement

As part of the Program, we require that you produce an article/tutorial and publish it (for example on [Medium](https://medium.com/)). It should explain your work done as part of the grant.

Normally, we ask you to submit the write-up upon the completion of your grant, although for larger projects it might make sense to publish multiple articles after the completion of different milestones.

## Future Plans

Please include the team's long-term plans and intentions.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** Web3 Foundation Website / Medium / Twitter / Element / Announcement by another team / personal recommendation / etc.

Here you can also add any additional information that you think is relevant to this application but isn't part of it already, such as:

* Work you have already done.
* Wheter there are any other teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project.
* Previous grants you may have applied for.
