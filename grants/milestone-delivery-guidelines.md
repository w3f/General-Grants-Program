# Milestone Deliverables Guidelines

We kindly ask you to consider the following guidelines when you submit a milestone for evaluation. Please submit your milestones by email to grants@web3.foundation.

The submission should contain the following information: 
 * **Name of the grant project**
 * **Link to the open-source code/delivery** 
 * **Basic [testing guide](#testing-guide)** 
 * **A list of the [milestone deliverables](#milestone-deliverables)**
 * **Any [additional information](#additional-information)**

## Testing Guide

Please provide documentation on how to install, compile, run, and/or test the deliverable. Documentation must be publicly available, such as a readme file or similar. This will make it easier for the community to use or adapt this project. For installation, we prefer docker images to avoid problems with versions and dependencies.

## Milestone Deliverables

Please provide a list of milestone deliverables. This list should closely reflect the list of deliverables shown in Annex 1 of the grant contract. Each item in the list should include a link to the deliverable itself. If necessary, please highlight anything that deviates from the contract and include further information that you think is relevant to the deliverable.

Please ensure the repo has the correct open-source license.

| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| 1. | ... |...| ...| 
| 2.  | ... |...| ...| 

## Additional Information

Please add any additional comments that you consider relevant for the evaluation.
