# Milestone Deliverables Guidelines

We kindly ask you to consider the following guidelines when you submit a milestone for evaluation. Please submit your milestones by email to grants@web3.foundation.

The submission should contain the following information: 
 * **Name of the grant project**
 * **Link to the open-source code/delivery** (including the correct open-source license)
 * **Basic [testing guide](#testing-guide)** 
 * **A list of the [milestone deliverables](#milestone-deliverables)**
 * **Any [additional information](#additional-information)**

## Testing Guide

Please provide documentation on how to install, compile and/or test the delivery. Ideally, this is done in the form of a publicly available readme file or something similiar, so that others can potentially leverage the project and learn from it. For the installation, we prefer docker images to avoid issues with versions and dependencies.

## Milestone Deliverables

Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application (see Annex1 of the Agreement) and a link to the deliverable itself. Add additional notes to the deliverable, especially in case it deviates from the initial contract. 

| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| 1. | ... |...| ...| 
| 2.  | ... |...| ...| 

## Additional Information

Please add any additional comments that you consider relevant for the evaluation.
