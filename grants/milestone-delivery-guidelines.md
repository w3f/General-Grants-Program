# Milestone Deliverables Guidelines

We kindly ask you to consider the following guidelines when you submit a milestone for evaluation. Please submit your milestones by email to grants@web3.foundation.

The submission should contain the following information: 
 * **Name of the grant project**
 * **Link to the open-source code/delivery** 
 * **Basic [testing guide](#testing-guide)** 
 * **A list of the [milestone deliverables](#milestone-deliverables)**
 * **Any [additional information](#additional-information)**

## Testing Guide

Please provide documentation on how to install, compile, run, and/or test the delivery. Documentation must be publicly available, such as a readme file or similar. This will make it easier for community to use or adapt this project. For installation, we prefer docker images to avoid problems with versions and dependencies.

## Milestone Deliverables

Please provide a list of milestone deliverables. This list should closely reflect the list of deliverables shown in Annex 1 of the grant contract. Each item in the list should include a link to the deliverable itself. If necessary, please highlight anything that deviates from the contract and include further information that you think is relevant to deliverable.

| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| 1. | ... |...| ...| 
| 2.  | ... |...| ...| 

Please ensure the repo has the correct open-source license.

## Additional Information

Please add any additional comments that you consider relevant for the evaluation.
