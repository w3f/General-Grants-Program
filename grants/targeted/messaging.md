# HOPR

## Project Description
This grant application supports the development of a decentralized and privacy-preserving messaging protocol called HOPR. Within the framework of this grant application we will be able to finalize a first specification, implementation of the protocol and assess how HOPR could improve the Substrate & Polkadot stack and how dedicated HOPR parachain could benefit the development of the protocol. Validity Labs recently started developing HOPR as a privacy-preserving and incentivized messaging protocol which provides:
* metadata-anonymity (and not just end-to-end encryption) via Chaumian onion encryption
* incentives for relayers that get paid by the sender of a message or third parties (similar to meta-transactions currently discussed for other blockchains) instead of just relying on services by altruistic parties (e.g. as required for TOR)
* efficient implementations without proof-of-work or SNARKs that would hinder adoption on embedded or mobile devices
* a scalable network architecture (in contrast to snowball-messaging, e.g. Whisper)
* a payment layer that is currently being implemented for Ethereum but here we aim to evaluate how we can more efficiently implement payment layers with Substrate / Polkadot
* a messaging layer that is building upon the SPHINX message format

While we have seen some prior work in the ecosystem towards privacy-preserving messaging protocols (e.g. Whisper, Orchid, Matrix), we are still missing a go-to protocol that is scalable, provides metadata anonymity and incentivizes node operators.

## Team's experience
Sebastian is co-founder and CTO of Validity Labs and leads a mostly technical team of 17. Before co-founding Validity Labs he worked as a Postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zurich in the domain of microtechnology for biomedical applications. Prior to Validity Labs, he co-founded SONECT, a Swiss fintech startup backed by PostFinance and other major financial infrastructure providers. Sebastian has been developing in the Ethereum ecosystem since 2015, the first public example was a decentralized lab book developed during the hack.ether.camp hackathon in 2015 (https://github.com/dlabbook https://youtu.be/GXSTKjS7UZE).

Robert holds an MSc degree in Computer Science from TU Darmstadt with a specialization in IT security. He is full time with Validity Labs since beginning of August 2018 to work on the architecture and implementation of a privacy-preserving messaging protocol.

Matt joined Validity Labs in November 2017 as a decentralized application developer and has worked across the full dApp stack from smart contracts to web technologies. He is also CEO of Pactum IO, LLC, providing graphical user interfaces for creating configurable smart contracts. Matt holds a degree in Computer Science from Midwestern State University Texas.

## Intended language of development
* JavaScript

The first implementation of the HOPR protocol will be in JavaScript in order to cater to both backend services running as a NodeJS CLI application as well as browser-based dapps. We deem this crucial for fast adoption of early showcases that give us a feeling for the viability of the approach.

## Development Roadmap
This grant application is targeting a 4 months implementation and assessment timeline during which we aim to reach the following milestones:
* Milestone 1: Objectives and specifications
   * Gather objectives with other stakeholders in the community
   * Specifications of the protocol's features in order to meet these objectives 
   * Deliverables: objectives and specifications detailed publicly on GitHub
   * Duration: 1 month
   * Funding: CHF 25'000
* Milestone 2: Proof of concept implementation
   * JavaScript implementation of the protocol's message layer utilizing libp2p
   * Implementation, testing, and integration of the payment layer mechanisms (on Ethereum using Ether as payment for proof of concept)
   * Deliverables: Working code available publicly on GitHub
   * Duration: 2 months
   * Funding: CHF 40'000
* Milestone 3: Evaluation
   * Assess the usefulness of the protocol and its implementation to meet the desired objectives identified in Milestone 1
   * Assess how the protocol could improve privacy and security of Substrate and Polkadot
   * Assess how a dedicated Polkadot parachain could be used as a payment layer
   * Deliverables: Report on findings publicly available on GitHub
   * Duration: 1 month
   * Funding: CHF 25'000

The total funding is CHF 90'000. Validity Labs plans to spin out the protocol in a separate legal entity that generates revenue by taking a cut of relayer fees (this initial business model is under discussion and might be subject to change) in order to sustainably finance protocol development.

## Additional Information
Validity Labs started some initial research and development on this project which is publicly available under https://github.com/validitylabs/messagingProtocol (GPL3 license). The initial research and development is so far exclusively financed by Validity Labs, no further grant applications are pending at this time.
