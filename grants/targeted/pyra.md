# Pyra

## Project Description
This grant application supports the managing and development of all parachains 

Pyra can
* Select parachain platform to develop and fetch the parachain project templates and build it to start development like [create-react-app]()
* Manage IDE to connect with the project
* Test codes with `pyra test` without relocating directory in command line
* Build and run projects with `pyra build` and `pyra run` without relocating directory in command line
* Give unified development guidebook on developing a parachain in Polkadot ecosystem
* Provide birds-eye view of parachain development ecosystem with its usage analysis

I made this tool to develop the parachain, but I want to scale up this project as some of them are interested.

## Team members
* Developer: Hyungsuk Kang

## Team Website	
WIP

## Legal Structure 
WIP, I need teammates to build this into business

## Team's experience
Hyungsuk Kang is an open source developer who has made substrate-name-service for hacktoberfest and contributed to Speckle-browser-extension. He is now making `prometheus!` macro to integrate prometheus with Polkadot/Substrate.

## Intended language of development
* Rust
I made this for learning Rust, so I am using its full features. Rust will also be used for pyra to have a console to communicate with parachain with `subxt`.

## Development Roadmap
This grant application is targeting a 4 months implementation and assessment timeline during which we aim to reach the following milestones:
* Milestone 1: Build first platform support with substrate 
   * Finish substrate integration with pyra (test/build/run) with yarnish interface, use github api to bundle them as one repo
   * Provide detailed documentation of pyra and its architecture
   * Deliverables: logo, architecture, implementation and documentation detailed publicly on GitHub
   * Duration: 1 month
   * Funding: 100 DOT
* Milestone 2: Make tutorial website like [google-code-lab-tool](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tools) and share substrate development tutorial on Pyra
   * Make a codelabs and website to build developer ecosystem
   * Deliverables: Codelab on how to develop substrate-name-service on Pyra
   * Duration: 1 month
   * Funding: 100 DOT
* Milestone 3: Add support for other parachain teams including Speckle, Packt Care, and etc.
   * Integrate other parachain developer repository to fetch/build/run with pyra
   * Add another codelab from the other parachain development team in pyra website 
   * Deliverables: New codelab from other parachain development team
   * Duration: 1 month
   * Funding: 100 DOT

The total funding is 300 DOT. I plan to nurture the Polkadot ecosystem development and want to see interesting projects using this.
