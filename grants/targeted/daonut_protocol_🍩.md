# The Düç©H-nut Protocol

## Project Description
If this application is for a particular grant programme then please indicate that in the first line of this section.
- New chains: interesting new blockchains that can act as para-chains
- https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/issues/11

### Problem: 
There are lots of users engaging on Web2 platforms, but Web2 platforms are limited in their functionality. Web3 platforms have lots of functionality, but limited engagement from users. There needs to be an organic low-friction way to bridge the two.

### Solution:
The Düç©H-nut protocol is creating a framework that allows Web2 users and communities to organically and iteratively explore the capabilities of Web3 technologies. It is an extension of the /r/ethtrader donuts, but fully decentralized using DAOs and a modular toolkit for community integration. This will allow users on communities like Reddit to explore the capabilities of web3 in a context that is organic and familiar. The project is FOSS and constantly evolving. Developers, communities, and anyone who wants can create DAOs or cryptoeconomic mechanisms and submit them to the "daonut app store" which anyone can then integrate into their community (like how Substrate allows for modules to be integrated easily).

This will require building:
- a spec for the protocol (Substrate chain)
- a framework for communities to easily engage with the technology and integrate it into their applications (docs and tutorial)
- a working demo that shows how the protocol works and also serves as a template that can be forked and modified as desired (combo of the two above)

We're currently exploring building this on many platforms such as Ethereum, Plasma, and POA, but a grant to help us build on Substrate/Polkadot would help us open up the ecosystem to a host of new developers and users. It would be an onramp to web3 that's organic and social vs being controlled by exchanges, which would help the Web3 Foundation accomplish it's mission of a decentralised interoperable web where users are in control of their own data, identity and destiny. We really hope you share our passion for this project and help us make this dream a reality :)

## Team members
* burrrata (requesting this grant to build this on Substrate and make it accessible to the Polkadot ecosystem)
* carlslarson (building this on Ethereum and Aragon)
* more community members tbd, but we welcome open collaboration (btw if we had more cash we could roll out bounties... just sayin)

## Legal Structure 
FOSS AF

## Team's experience
carlslarson has built an initial version of this protocol on Ethereum called RECDAO, and we are now upgrading it with a smoother UX, more modular components, and less fees

burrrata is an opinionated piece of cheese on the internet that's passionate about FOSS and cryptoeconomic mechanisms that align incentives to create positive sum games

## Development Roadmap

Resources Required: we want to move fast and ship before the Polkadot mainnet launch, thus the request is below the recommended 30k for speedy processing üöÄ
- if fiat only: 25k ASAP)
- if 50/50 fiat/dots: 29.99k

Timeline
* 50% of budget: R&D for a working Substrate prototype that pulls data from Reddit in a trust-less manner
  - starts now
* 20% of budget: Delivery of a working Substrate prototype that pulls data from Reddit in a trust-less manner
  - this will take 1-3 months
* 20% of budget: Delivery of a tutorial around that prototype so that others can understand how it works and recreate it
  - 1 month after the delivery of the working prototype
* 10% of budget: Integration with a pretty UI like SpeckleOS or a web interface so that users can interact with the demo visually
  - 1 month after the delivery of the demo
  
We hope that with your help we can have Web2/Web3 integration as a feature of Substrate that any new user can understand and build into their chain before the main net launch.


What are the team‚Äôs long-term plans and intentions after the grant has been award?
- improve the UX/UI for end users
- add features to link Reddit usernames to contracts that allocate tokens based on karma
- create a demo and docs for the the above features
- create partnerships and direct integrations with platforms like Reddit (we're already talking to their devs about this)
- create APIs that make it easy for other developers to either build chains that interact with these type of "oracle chains"

This could change the way people think about and interact with blockchains, creating organic social bridges to Web3 that are free from the constraints and UX nightmares of exchanges. This changes the narrative of blockchains from cryptocurrencies as financial applications to Web3 as an upgrade to the way we communicate and connect data. If we're really serious about making Web3 decentralized and accessible to as many people as possible, it's essential that we have fun and organic on-ramps that integrate with users desires and expectations. The Düç©H-nut protocol (really an oracle solution that creates Web2/Web3 data bridges) is a small step for Substrate, but a huge leap for Web3 :)
