# Daonut Protocol üç©

## Project Description
If this application is for a particular grant programme then please indicate that in the first line of this section.
- New chains: interesting new blockchains that can act as parachains
- https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/issues/11

### Problem: 
There are lots of users engaging on web2 platforms, but web2 platforms are limited in their functionality. Web3 platforms have lots of functionality, but limited engagement from users. There needs to be an organic low-friction way to bridge the two.

### Solution:
The daonut protocol is creating a framework that allows web2 users and communities to organically and iteratively explore the capabilities of web3 technologies. It is an extension of the /r/ethtrader donuts, but fully decentralized using DAOs and a modular toolkit for community integration. This will allow users on communities like Reddit to explore the capabilities of web3 in a context that is organic and familiar. The project is FOSS and constantly evolving. Developers, communities, and anyone who wants can create DAOs or cryptoeconomic mechanisms and submit them to the "daonut app store" which anyone can then integrate into their community (like how Substrate allows for modules to be integrated easily).

This will require building:
- a spec for the protocol
- a framework for communities to easily engage with the technology and integrate it into their applications
- a working demo that shows how the protocol works and also serves as a template that can be forked and modified as desired

We're currently exploring building this on many platforms such as Ethereum, Plasma, and POA, but a grant to help us build on Substrate/Polkadot would help us open up the ecosystem to a host of new developers and users. It would be an onramp to web3 that's organic and social vs being controlled by exchanges, which would help the Web3 Foundation accomplish it's mission of a decentralised interoperable web where users are in control of their own data, identity and destiny. We really hope you share our passion for this project and help us make this dream a reality :)

* burrrata
* carlslarson	
* more community members tbd, but we welcome open collaboration (btw if we had more cash we could roll out bounties... just sayin)

## Team Website	
* https://daonuts.org/

## Legal Structure 
FOSS AF

## Team's experience
carlslarson has built an initial version of this protocol on Ethereum called RECDAO, and we are now upgrading it with a smoother UX, more modular components, and less fees

burrrata is a piece of cheese on the internet that's passionate about FOSS and cryptoeconomic mechanisms that align incentives to create positive sum games

## Team LinkedIn Profiles
* LinkedIn is gross 

## Development Roadmap

* We are drafting the spec as we speak on /r/daonuts 
- https://www.reddit.com/r/daonuts/comments/an60np/daonut_design_flavors/

* We will begin working on prototypes next week
- current contenders are Plasma, POA, and Polkadot

* We hope to have a working demo within 3 months
- this will then be shared for the /r/ethtrader and /r/donuttrader communities to try out and give feedback on
- we will then iteratively upgrade it and add a governance mechanism so that the community can augment and contribute as desired
- it will hopefully be a fully open source project in 6 months that multiple communities are implementing and contributing to including better UIs, better modules, and smoother integrations with web2 platforms

* Indicate the amount of funding required. Both the amount per milestone and the total amount.
- if fiat only: 25k (we want to move fast, so we'll take a low amount to get started ASAP)
- if 50/50 fiat/dots: 50k

* What are the team‚Äôs long-term plans and intentions after the grant has been award?
- build more tools that make exploring and integrating with web3 FUN (much yum üç©) as well as meaningful (self sovereign identity, data, etc...)
