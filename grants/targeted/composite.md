# Composite IDE Grant Application

## Project Description

Composite is an open source IDE that simplifies smart contract development, debugging, and deployment on the Polkadot parachains.

Composite is built from scratch for blockchains. Composite supports multiple blockchains and includes blockchain-specific features unavailable in general purpose editors, such as one-click install and update of toolchains, and ABI interaction.

Composite was built using feedback from smart contract developers and has several unannounced partnerships. (See Google doc for list)

Target audience are both experienced smart contract developers looking for a more convenient way to develop, and experienced but new-to-crypto developers. Our aim is to bring net new developers to Polkadot.

The project scope is extending Composite to include one-click install of the Polkadot toolchain, adding support for Wasm and various languages for editing, interacting, debugging, and deploying smart contracts on the parachains.

One of the Composite backers (mentioned in the Google form) is encouraging us to include Wasm support for Ethereum, another potential backer has been encouraging us to look into formal verification support. Both efforts could be combined in the proposed project.

If the grant size allows, we're interested in writing a Mastering Polkadot Smart Contract book, in cooperation with a blockchain bootcamp educational company.

* Ronald is a Bay Area-based open source developer of Swifthereum, JSON-RPC Codable, NaiveSwiftCoin, and other frameworks. Ronald co-founded crypto startup Coral, and two (non-crypto) hardware startups. He worked as consultant to FirstCoin. His PhD research topic was trust in P2P networks (not finished). Ronald has 9 years of iOS and MacOS development, several years of C development and UX design before that. 
* Jorn and Ronald are former college roommates and worked together at two different startups. Composite is the third project they're collaborating on. Jorn has over 10 years of iOS and MacOS developer experience.

## Intended language of development

* Swift
* Bash

Choosing a language is per definition accepting a compromise. While many new projects use Javascript/Electron, we deliberately chose to create a native application. 

The obvious downside is the lack of support for Linux and Windows. With MacOS seemingly being the platform of choice for most developers nowadays, we provide the best experience for the largest group first, and will decide whether or not to port Composite to other platforms at a later stage.

We believe native apps provide a user experience unmatched by Electron apps. Not only are native apps obviously better with it comes to perfomance and use of resources, native apps also automatically support the accessibility features that come with MacOS. Composite is likely the only crypto tool that can be used by developers who depend on accessibility features.

## Development Roadmap

* Composite Public Beta 1 will be available in Q1 2019. Our goal is to have a basic but usable version of Composite out as soon as possible. Depending on when the grant will be received, support for Polkadot parachains will be either added to Public Beta 1 or Public Beta 2.
* Public Beta 2, available in Q2 2019, will focus on improved editor, tighter toolchain integration, and resource optimizations. 
* Optionally, the book Mastering Smart Contracts on Polkadot Parachains will be released around Public Beta 2.
* Long term ambition is to become the default IDE for smart contracts with support added for all major blockchains. After Public Beta 2, development on Composite will continue, with focus on improved integration with already supported blockchains and adding support for more blockchains.

The project:

* 1.5 fulltime developers
* parttime product manager / user research
* parttime UX/UI designer
* parttime book editor (optional)

So far, Composite has been **fully self-funded**.

Requested grant:

* **$240,000** including book
* **$190,000** without book

Up to **50%** of grant in Dot works for us.

## Additional Information

* Confirmed unannouned grant (see Google form for details)
* Very early pre-alpha version with Ethereum support available
