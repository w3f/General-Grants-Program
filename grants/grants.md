# Web3 Foundation Grants

As part of our commitment to promoting the Web3 ecosystem, we are providing a comprehensive grants initiative. This means that successful applicants will be able to receive funding for their efforts to improve the Web3 ecosystem.

## Grant Application Types
There are two separate types of grant application:

* **Targeted** programmes where we ask for proposals, reach out, etc. Generally where the foundation is active. These will be done via:
  * Request for Proposals (RfPs)

## Process
The grant application can be seen as a 5-step process. Below is an outline of these 5 steps.
  
1. **Communication**
   * See the list all of all programmes, bounties and RfPs (in a previous section).
   * If your idea isn&rsquo;t listed, but you think it&rsquo;s cool, you can send us an email or get in touch via Riot.
1. **Application**
   * Creating an application involves creating a pull request into this repository. There is a template for the application itself (a new file) and there is a template for the body of the pull request itself.
     1. First step is to fork this repository. In the newly created fork, you will create a new file that will hold the content of your application.
     1. The new file should contain the project name. If you are applying for one of our targeted programme grants then create the new file should be created in that sub-folders, likewise if it is speculative then use that sub-folder: [Targeted](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/tree/master/grants/targeted), [Speculative](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/tree/master/grants/speculative).
     1. The new file should be a copy of the content of the application template, but filled out with the details of your project. See the **application template** file: [Link](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/blob/master/grants/grant_application_template.md)  
     1. Once you have filled out the template, and are happy that it is complete, click on "create new pull request".
     1. The body of the pull request body will show a template that requests an abstract of the project and contains a checklist. Please complete as approriate. The **pull request template** is here: [Link](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/grant_application.md)
   * Please take care to include all necessary information!
1. **Review**
   * W3F will review the applications received and determine if more information is required and potentially schedule a call with the team.
1. **Decision**
   * W3F will notify the applicants of whether their proposal has been accepted for grant funding or not.
   * If a team is successful, there will be further conversation required to figure out specific details around timelines and payment schedules.
1. **Follow up**
   * Once progress has started, W3F will want to have follow up conversations to see how the project is developing.
