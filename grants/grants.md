# Web3 Foundation Grants

As part of our commitment to promoting the Web3 ecosystem, we are providing a comprehensive grants initiative. This means that successful applicants will be able to receive funding for their efforts to improve the Web3 ecosystem.

[Apply Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMfjiRmDQDRk-4OhNASM6BAKii7rz_B1jWtbCPkUh6N7M2ww/viewform)

Primarily, we are interested in grants that have a maximum lifespan of 6 months or less. It is possible that further funding can occur, but we want the projects to be smaller in nature and hence a more manageable risk. With Polkadot coming online in Q3 2019 (target timeframe), then we would like to have many projects funded and delivered in advance.

## Grant Application Types
There are two separate types of grant application:

* **Targeted** programmes where we ask for proposals, reach out, etc. Generally where the foundation is active. These will be done via:
  * Request for Proposals (RfPs)
  * Direct Outreach
* **Speculative** applications where the outside connects to us and asks if we want to fund them. A list of areas of interest are in the next section.

## Areas of interest
The Web3 foundation is interested in providing grants in the different areas of interest shown below. If any of these topics are of interest to you then please make a speculative application and request funding for your project. Our focus is to support projects building around **Substrate** or **Polkadot** (and more technologies going forward). For projects related to Ethereum please refer to [ECF](https://ecf.network/) that we are members of.

* **Software Development**
  * Development and deployment tooling
    * IDEs
    * Dependency management
    * Testing frameworks
    * Scalable cluster
    * Tools for easy deployment
    * Parachain development kits
  * New languages and libraries
    * Targeting deterministic Wasm
  * New chains
    * Interesting new blockchains that can act as parachains
    * Adaptations of existing blockchains as parachains
  * Protocol integrations

## Who are we interested in?
  We provide funding in these areas to these kind of people:

* Individuals
  * Developers, anyone in the community
* Companies/Teams
  * Established teams with a track record
* Researchers
  * Universities/Professors
  
## Process
The grant application can be seen as a 5-step process. Below is an outline of these 5 steps.
  
1. **Communication**
   * See the list all of all programmes, bounties and RfPs (in a previous section).
   * If your idea isn&rsquo;t listed, but you think it&rsquo;s cool, you can send us an email or get in touch via Riot.
1. **Application**
   * Applications should be made via a pull request into this repo. We appreciate that not all teams will want to make the financial details public, so there is a Google Form to collect such information. Bare in mind that we are looking for projects with timeframes of less than 6 months.
   * Example application: [Application](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/pull/49/files), [Pull Request](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/pull/49)
   * Steps for applying: 
     1. We would like **all** teams to start by adding a few details to our dedicated [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMfjiRmDQDRk-4OhNASM6BAKii7rz_B1jWtbCPkUh6N7M2ww/viewform). This makes it easy for us to manage all applications in one place. Afterwards, please continue to fill out the appropriate GitHub templates.
        * This Google Form also allows teams to send any private financial information to supplement their public application, or for teams to make a fully private application. Note that priority will be given to public applications.
     1. For public applications, with or without public financial information, the next step is to fork this repository.
     1. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the **application template** ([Link](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/blob/master/grants/grant_application_template.md)), and make sure to add it to the correct sub-folder depending on whether it is a [Targeted](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/tree/master/grants/targeted), or [Speculative](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/tree/master/grants/speculative) application. Most applications will be into the speculative folder.
     1. Label the file as "project_name.md".
     1. Fill out the template with the details of your project.
     1. Once you have filled out the template, and are happy that it is complete, click on "create new pull request".
     1. The body of the pull request will show a template that requests an abstract of the project and the completion of a checklist. Please complete as approriate. The **pull request template** can be viewed here: [Link](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/grant_application.md)
   * Please take care to include all necessary information!
1. **Review**
   * W3F will review the applications received and determine if more information is required and potentially schedule a call with the team.
1. **Decision**
   * W3F will notify the applicants of whether their proposal has been accepted for grant funding or not.
   * If a team is successful, there will be further conversation required to figure out specific details around timelines and payment schedules.
1. **Follow up**
   * Once progress has started, W3F will want to have follow up conversations to see how the project is developing.
