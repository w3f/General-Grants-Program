# Guidelines for Web3 Foundation Grants Program Badge

<img align="right" width="400" src="../src/badge_black.svg">

**Once a winning team completed the first grant milestone**, we want to help them acknowledge their grants publicly
while observing the foundation’s guidelines.

To that end, we’ve created a badge for grant-winning teams. The badge in four formats will
be available for download as a “.zip” file from [web3.foundation/grants/badge](https://web3.foundation/grants/badge). Think of it like
a medal or trophy.

*Before you begin using the badge, please note the following points:*

Grants are awarded for specific projects, not to teams in general as a blanket endorsement.
Web3 Foundation and its grants program don’t broker partnerships or joint ventures; or
cosign wholesale any external team’s work. Bearing that in mind, **the badge should only be
displayed in project-specific contexts.**

Please do: display the badge in a GitHub repository that contains code connected with the
grant-winning project; on any project-specific webpages; and, when appropriate, in a tweet
or blog post announcing your grant in a project-specific context.

Please don’t: display the badge on your team’s landing page; add it to any social media
profiles; or use it in any contexts that could misrepresent your relationship to Web3
Foundation.

In case of any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us at grants@web3.foundation.
