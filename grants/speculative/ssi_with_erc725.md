## Project Description
Software Development - Polkadot Runtime Modules - Interesting new Modules (+ Governance and Interoperability)

* Add Self Sovereign Identity as a runtime module following the ERC725 standard and the DIDs specification and using Verifiable Claims. 
* All applications in the Blockchain Ecosystem need Digital Identity. even more, they need a standard so all dapps can use the same Identity (it's interoperable). Also from a polkadot perspective, a Universal Resolver can be also included at the Runtime.
* At Caelum Labs we are the founders of Alastria (National Blockchain Ecosystem) and we are also part of the ERC725 Alliance. We believe this is the natural evolution for a global Self Sovereign Identity.

You can find our SSI proposal  ( code name Sikaris, work on progress) here : https://gitlab.com/caelumlabs/sikaris

We wnat to leverage the power of Polkadot to build a Local-Regional-National networkf of Parachains dedicated to SSI where most of the communication goes offchain (P2P with Whisper)

## Intended language of development
* Rust

We are currently working in Rust. And Substrate is made in Rust too :)

## Development Roadmap
* February 28th : Module to add ERC725 Identities
* March 1st-3rd : Working group at rebboting the web of trust
* April 30th : DIDs implementation (following the W3C standard)
* June 30th : Polkadot integration
* If the team would consider part payments in fiat and/or dots then please suggest a percentage here.
* Turning Polkadot into a interconnected global Self Sovereign Id platform. Making these Ids valid and legal and build bridges between countries (p2p) for people and organisations.

## Additional Information
* Any additional information that you think is relevant to this application.
