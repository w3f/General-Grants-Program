# Project name
GunClear

## Project Description
* Our mission is to provide the firearm industry with a private and secure data storage solution for firearm ownership history and transactions.
* GunClear is a valuable project that solves a real problem which can't be solved without the use of this technology. If successful, we will engender adoption by a community completely outside the Web3 ecosystem.
* Our plan is to develop our production network leveraging Substrate as it's base. It will integrate various technologies including a Plasma bridge to Ethereum and zk-SNARKs proof generation and verification allowing private transfers on the child chain.
* Substrate helps us solve a problem being giving us a secure base to build our network on. It also integrates libp2p, which we will be working to incorporate better privacy-centric p2p networking technology inside of to support our use case.

## Team members

## Development Roadmap
* 6 month timeline is to develop a draft Plasma contract and client in Substrate, demonstrate it working.
  * This timeline includes many other tasks, including the incorporation of zk-SNARKs tech.
* We are currently in a capital raise to collect enough money to build out the MVP and go to market.
  * A $30k+ grant would help us get our engineering team started on this path sooner than later.
* When the product MVP is built, we intend on going to market with the product in partnership with a range of industry players and building our community.

## Licensing
All GunClear backend code will be open sourced under the MIT software license.

## Additional Information
* We have a proof of concept already built ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJsILw4BJs))
* We have accepted angel financing to build the PoC
