## Project Description
**Substrate Chrome Extensions DApp Wallet**

We intend to create a Chrome Extension DApp Wallet. Similar to Metamask, this wallet will be compatible with substrate core and configurable to the modules used by any standard parachain. When a user creates a parachain, they will very quickly have a professionally made, well-tested Chrome Extension DApp Wallet. This can also interoperate between all substrate chains.
