# Web3 Analytics

## Project Description

Web3 Analytics is a decentralized Google Analytics alternative aiming to give users the full control of their data. It provides web performance measurement, customized statistics, and data visualization dashboard. With the power of TEE, users' personal data are kept secretly and can only be used in an approved way. As a result, users literally get the 100% control of their data.

### The Problem

We are going to build a decentralized off-chain data management and statistics tool to solve the following problems:

* Web3 developers have no choice but to trust big internet companies and use online statistics tools like Google Analytics. (More than 70% of the websites are using Google Analytics)
* However in such centralized solutions, the big companies control all the users data. Users have no way to download or delete their data, neither decide how the data is used by others.
* Finally, users and developers cannot profit from the additional value created by their data.

### How to Protect Personal Data?

* In Web3 Analytics SDK, the user data is end-to-end encrypted. The encrypted data is stored in a decentralized storage network.
* Only the user and the confidential smart contract has the access of the encryption key. Therefore users can manage the data, the access permission of the data, and can also delete the data on their own. The confidential contract only analyze the data in ways authorized by the user in a TEE enclave.
* Authorized confidential contract can analyze the encrypted user data and output the analysis results. The results are displayed on W3A data visualization dashboard.
* All the analysis requests are logged on the blockchain. When the analysis is a part of the data trading, the value of the deal is recorded transparently on the blockchain, and the profit of the deal can be distributed to the data owners in a transparent way. Details are discussed in the next section.

### Features

The main features of Web3 Analytics are:

* Automatic and customized event measurement and statistics for Web and Mobile apps
* Decentralized data management: Users can 100% manage the collected data and its access permission on a personal data console
* Developer dashboard: Show the visualized analysis results to the developers
* Data Plaza: A marketplace for data trading

The Data Plaza is a novel service to buy and sell data. By putting the data into confidential smart contracts (inside TEE enclaves), the original data is invisible to the buyer. So it enables the trade of data usage but not ownership.

* The buyer writes W3A confidential contract to do the customized analysis
* The contract will only execute if it's approved by the developer and the users
* The computation is done strictly inside the TEE enclave. So there's no data leakage.
* The buyer gets the result after the payment of the data usage.
* The revenue will be distributed to the developers and data owners in a predefined way.


### How is it Decentralized

The analysis and the data management is done by Phala.Network confidential contract. Phala.Network is a decentralized TEE-Blockchain network.

Until the public beta, the data will be served in a semi-decentralized way. The W3A team will store the encrypted data on some public cloud storage providers. The data is encrypted and distributed over the IPFS network. The address of the encrypted files are public available. So everyone can replicate the encrypted data on demand.

We will switch to pure decentralized storage networks when they are available (e.g. Filecoin). This is supposed to happen before our final release.

Finally, the identity management is different for guests and signed in users. For guests, the SDK will generate a key pair as the identity. When a guest signs in (i.e. sign in the personal data console), the console will rotate the temporary key and handle the key management in the future.

### Background

* Confidential Contract: W3A is based on [Phala.Network](https://phala.network), the confidential smart contract protocol share with our earlier W3F grant project [pLIBRA](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/blob/master/grants/speculative/pLIBRA.md).
* Relation to Substrate and Polkadot: W3A, pLIBRA, and Phala.Network are built on Substrate and we would like it to become a Polkadot Parachain.

### Open Source

This is an open source project under Apache License 2.0. All the defined milestones will be available to the open source community.

## Additional Information

* What work has been done so far?
  * Phala.Network blockchain Substrate runtime (WIP)
  * Phala.Network TEE miner runtime (WIP)
  * Phala.Network blockchain-TEE bridge
  * Data Plaza PoC (confidential contract and frontend)
* Are there are any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project?
  * No.
* Have you applied for other grants so far?
  * Yes, [pLIBRA](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/blob/master/grants/speculative/pLIBRA.md) (WIP).
* Are there any other projects similar to yours?
  * We are the first decentralized Google Analytics alternative. To our knowledge, there's no similar project.
  * Phala.Network's TEE-Blockchain hybrid architecture design is similar to [Ekiden](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05141) but supports cross-contract/blockchain interoperability in addition. Thus we can fit into the Web3 technology stack better.
  * Both Phala.Network and [Substrate SGX](https://github.com/libra-china-org/Web3-collaboration/blob/master/grants/speculative/substrate_sgx_proposal.md) uses TEE technology and we are likely to share some components in the future.
