# CCDEXChain
## Project Description
We are building a cross-chain bridge for Polkadot. 
The publickey algorithm used by the polkadot network is ed25519/sr25519, we want to design an algorithm based on MPC that can support distributed generation of EDDSA signature. Based on our previous work, the ECDSA distributed signature of the cross-chain bridging BTC and ETH networks has been implemented. Combined with the EDDSA algorithm, the nodes of the polkadot parallel chain can decentralized cross-chain with the BTC, ETH and other networks.

* The general approach to bridge design.

We implementing the decentralization of private key control assets through the MPC algorithm. This means that a private key controlled account(MPC Account) can be controlled by multiple keys. These keys are generated cooperatively by multiple p2p network nodes through the MPC algorithm.  

After the user deposit BTC/ETH to the MPC account, the cross-chain bridge verifies the deposit transaction then issues the corresponding assets on the substrate/polkadot contract which also controlled by the same MPC nodes. These assets theoretically include all ECDSA and EDDSA assets. Applications such as exchange can be completed through smart contracts.

* Architecture on the issuing blockchain (Parachain architecture)

On the substrate/polkadot side, ccdexchain create a MPC account on bitcoin/ethereum which controlled by decentralized nodes. Create a MPC contract on substrate/polkadot which used for issues the corresponding assets.

* Architecture on the backing blockchain (the external chain)

On the bitcoin/ethereum side,  Bitcoin/ethereum does not need to be modified.

* How the process works to mint tokens on Polkadot

The ccdexchain monitors the user's MPC account, if a new deposit transaction occurs, after several blocks are confirmed, the corresponding assets are issued in the corresponding MPC contract. The operation of issuing assets transaction requires MPC nodes to reach consensus and collaborative distributed signatures, which can ensure the security of asset deposit and issuance.

* How the process works to redeem tokens from Polkadot

After user send the withdrawal transaction on the MPC contract of the substitute/polkadot, contract burn the polkaBTC/ETH, and the ccdexchain is triggered to generate a corresponding withdrawal transaction. This transaction also requires MPC nodes to reach consensus and collaborative distributed signatures,  which can ensure the security of withdrawal and burn assets.
