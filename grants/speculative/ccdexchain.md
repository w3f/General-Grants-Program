# CCDEXChain
## Project Description
We are building a cross-chain bridge for Polkadot. 
The publickey algorithm used by the polkadot network is ed25519/sr25519, we want to design an algorithm based on MPC that can support distributed generation of EDDSA signature. Based on our previous work, the ECDSA distributed signature of the cross-chain bridging BTC and ETH networks has been implemented. Combined with the EDDSA algorithm, the nodes of the polkadot parallel chain can decentralized cross-chain with the BTC, ETH and other networks.

* The general approach to bridge design.

* Architecture on the issuing blockchain (Parachain architecture)

* Architecture on the backing blockchain (the external chain)

* How the process works to mint tokens on Polkadot

* How the process works to redeem tokens from Polkadot
