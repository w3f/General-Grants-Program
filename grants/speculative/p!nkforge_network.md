# General Grant Proposal

* **Project:** P!nkForge Network

## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 
P!nkForge Network is trying to build a liquidity bootstrapping protocol which is comprised of diverse fundraising mechanism and liquidity providing for the parachain/parathread. 

The protocol will be built as a parachain in Kusama and Polkadot to help foster the ecosystem start-up projects in fundraising and instant token swap.

### Overview

#### Problem statement
Here are three common problems, two of them referred to current fundraising model, another one is about parathread economics in Kusama/Polkadot:
1. A crack between fundraising and token exchange.
   
    Projects that did an ICO or private sale for fundraising usually are hard to find a place for the token swap. For now, the solution would be going to a centralized exchange with an expensive IEO fee or uniswap with large-amount deposit for the kick-off liquidity, both are costly. 

2. Manual migration from ERC20 token to mainnet token.

    Considering that lots of projects did the fundraising at an idea/whitepaper stage, the team would issue an ERC20 token as a voucher. After couple of years you may migrate the ERC20 tokens to the mainnet if the project goes well.
     Some even set a limited window period for the migration, if you missed it, your tokens turn useless.
    
3. Instant token swap of parachain currencies.
    Parathread is a significant component of the Kusama/Polkadot ecosystem. A fact we know about the parathread economics is that the collators may be paid in local parathread currency while the Relay Chain transacts with KSM/DOT only.
    And now no built-in price finding mechanism and instant token swap market exist in Polkadot ecosystem.
    
#### How to solve
To solve the previous problems, this project need to realize these three features:
1. General and flexible fundraising models
2. An instant token swap market like Uniswap
3. A seamless and low-cost liquidity providing mechanism


> Uniswap, as we know, is a peer-to-peer decentralized cryptocurrency exchange that allows users to trade ERC20 tokens, and it works well despite its simplicity.

What we want to do is a one-stop bootstrap protocol. First it provides diverse fundraising models for the project, and then motivates the community to contribute a `locked` initial liquidity (so the team is able to spend more fund in building the project safely), last creates a uniswap-like market for instant token swap.
    
### Project Details 
To achieve the goals above, this project needs two major subsystems:

- An instant token swap market, we call it `P!nkSwap`
- A fundraising platform, we call it `P!nkCombinator`

#### 1. Fundraising Platform
To fulfill different teams' needs, we will support mutiple fundraising mechnism at first place such as the dutch auction, sealed-bid auction, candle auction, etc.
And also, the teams are allowed to initialize the liquidity pools with customed rules, encouraging the community to lock their KSM/DOT and projects' local tokens for a period of time in the pools.

For instance, this encouragement can be combined with a lockdrop event. In the traditional lockdrop, the users lock their KSM/DOT to get free tokens. While in `P!nkCombinator`, if the user continue to lock their tokens, this would be taken as an `add_liquidity` action. As a result, the users will not only get the free tokens but also 'locked' LP tokens which enables them to share the exchange fee during the locking period.


#### 2. Instant token swap market
After the liquidity pool has been set up, users are able to swap tokens. That means collators can swap their transaction fees and block rewards instantly to KSM/DOT to ensure that this block-wrap service is profitble.

Users can also do the parachain slot crowdfunding for the project they support through `P!nkSwap`. Below is the details of this process:

- Current slot auction crowdfunding

   End users specify the locking duration and transfer their KSMs/DOTs to a submodule account mapping to a specific parachain. They will be incentivized by the parachain they support, respectively.

- Slot auction crowdfunding with this platform

   End users will add_locked_liquidity(ksm_amount, parachain_tokens_amount, parachain_index, start_slot, end_slot) in this platform, within this add_locked_liquidity function it will atomically evoke the crowdfunding.contribute function to auctually crowdfund for the parachain safely.

   And in this fundraising platform, the end-users who call the add_locked_liquidity function will lock their KSMs/DOTs in the liquidity pool to continuously share the token-swap fees proportionally.

   In the future, we will come up with more economic incentives for the crowdfunding through on-chain governance.

### Community engagement

Definitely, P!nkForge project is and will be a community based porject, team member will be the one in community. We will get community involved by creating our P!nk Forum, discord group, telegram group, Medium account.

And their will be several ways to incentivize community to engage into P!nk test token Forging and token swapping.

On each milestone completion, P!nk will publish artcile to give a write-up.


## Future Plans

The long term plan for P!nkForge is to be the most robust and simple way on Forging tokens and Swapping tokens as what has done by UNI on Ethereum, but further beyond it a little. 

P!nk team believe that further beyond a little and one step by step is the way to create community-wise useful product to both contribute the Polkadot and the community.
