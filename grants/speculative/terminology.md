# Terrifying Terminology

## Project Description
A template/cheatsheet for people who want to understand the terminology of Substrate, Polkadot, and Web3 without all the confusing jargon. Hopefully this will lower the barriers to entry for those who are less technical while also providing a template for those creating education resources to reference in order to make their work more accessible. 

Terminology, is one of the biggest barriers to entry in the blockchain/web3 space. People are asking the same questions over and over, but mainly it's just because every new blockchain project invents their own terms for everything. It's hard enough to understand what's going on with Etheruem atm, and to layer on new terms from Substrate/Polkadot that often refer to the same thing is just a nightmare. I'd like to create a resource that explains the terminology of Substrate, Polkadot, and web3 in simple terms. 

I'm creating this because after browsing /r/dot for over a month, I've realized that I missed out on the best learning materials and resources simply because the content was not formatted in a way that was easy to access. As evidenced by the low engagement on the subreddit relative to other blockchain projects I'm not the only one. Polkadot is amazing and I'd love to talk to more people about it and jam on ideas to build stuff, but it's hard when there's so many barriers to entry. Hopefully a less terrifying terminology cheatsheet will help.

## Development Roadmap
* 1 month: read through all the docs and simplify things that are confusing, then share that with the community and get feedback and refine it. Ideally this will be more of a living document/project than a one and done static post.

* 1k for the initial draft, and then we can reasses ongoing "maintenance" of the project. Probably too small for "grant", but I'm just really frustrated that people don't realize how cool Polkadot is and keep building slow broken things on other blockchains. I really want to reduce the barriers to entry as much as possible so that we can see the ecosystem thrive. 

* 50/50 dots/fiat would be great!

* My favorite thing is jamming on ideas for cool applications or cryptoeconomic mechanisms, but I'm getting frustrated that there's so many great ideas that aren't being built. Substrate allows people to build things, fast, and Polkadot allows you to pool L1 security so that you can focus on prototyping and building your cool thing. I'd really like to see that process become as easy and intuitive as possible so people can come up with ideas, try stuff out, and then gather data from actual experiments to make better stuff next time (aka the scientific method). Happy to help with anything that helps people get from 0 => hero and explore more interesting and engaging cryptoeconomic mechanisms and tools for web3. This is just the first step, but then I'd like to finish a (WIP) Rust blockchain tutorial that builds a modular blockchain from first principles and then upgrades it from standard/simple modules in the Rust standard library to a full Substrate chain. Also working on web2/web3 data bridges to allow people on sites like Reddit to extend their experience with web3 capabilities.
