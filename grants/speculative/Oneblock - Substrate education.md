# Oneblock - Substrate education

## 1. Project Description

*Substrate Development - Build a blockchain from scratch* is the first online video course on the Substrate development guide in the world. It is developed by OneBlock+ learning community, together with Xiliang Chen, CTO at Laminar and an ambassador from Polkadot community. Currently the content is of the best quality, and the teaching mode is the most practical and the most system atic in all Substrate development training courses in the world. It provides an online tutorial to learn fast from scratch, and a network community for Chinese Polka technology enthusiasts and Substrate developers. And it will help Web3 build a Substrate developer ecosystem.

## 2. Project Detailed Introduction

### 2.1. Course Structure

We have designed a video course and launched it on `OneBlock+` platform (<https://appbhTEfFsI3308.h5.xeknow.com/st/7xJjRp1m2>). It is mainly for programmers who are interested in Substrate development to learn systematically in 1.5 months. The course was launched on June 5, 2019. So far, two course sessions have been successfully launched, and 100 Chinese Substrate developers have been trained. The third session is currently ongoing. In the next stage, we will continue to train more qualified Chinese Substrate developers. The course outline is as follows:

### 2.4. Sub Teaching Assistants

In order to help developers in each session to achieve the best learning outcome and improvement in ability, we not only need high-quality course content, but also need teaching assistants to give feedback on student assignments. We believe that outstanding students are the most suitable candidates for being teaching assistants. For this reason, we have specially launched the "Certified Teaching Assistant Program", hoping to enable some outstanding students from previous sessions to become Assistants in the Substrate curriculum, and through them to guarantee each new student an obvious ability improvement.

In summary, the teaching assistants’ job includes the following four main points:

Assignment Review: Write a review of the assignment submitted by the student and give a grade

Communication with Student: answer students’ questions, motivate students to learn, and build good relationships

Class Meeting Review: one TA will review assignment submitted by the class group every week, and needs to prepare reviewing content in advance

Sub Sharing: one TA will organize livestream knowledge sharing session once per week, and needs to prepare content in advance

In the past six months, we have recruited 21 Sub TAs. They played a very important role in our courses. We plan to recruit about 10 outstanding students to join the teaching team in each session.

![](https://github.com/jiangfuyao/yikuailianxi-image/raw/master/image5.png)

### 2.5. Sub Sharing

Sub Sharing is an online livestream session around Polkadot Eco. We organize one session every week during the course. Speakers are usually KOL, including lecturers, teaching assistants, and outstanding students. Everyone will summarize and share what they have learned. They will help the Polkadot team to expand their influence in China, and help Chinese developers and users to understand the ecology of Polkadot better. In addition, we also summarize the content into articles after the end of each session and publish them on the public Wechat account and top10 blockchain media platforms, so that more people get exposed to Polkadot.

You can click on the link below to see their understanding of Polkadot. They are a group of strategists and developers who really like and want to contribute to parachains and bridges.

### 2.7. Subdev workshop

Since July, we have held 5 offline workshops, with the theme such as Polkadot, Substrate, and Rust. We help developers learn Substrate technology via both lecturing and hands-on code teaching in on-site sessions.

![](https://github.com/jiangfuyao/yikuailianxi-image/raw/master/image6.png)

### 2.8.Introduction to projects based on Substrate by graduate students (part of them)

**1.Fuyao Jiang from Acala Network and Jianjiang Wang, Founder and CTO at Polkawallet** 

Acala Network heterogeneous cross-chain multi-asset mortgage financial platform. https://acala.network

The project has completed the white paper design and basic research, and they are pushing into the development of the mainnet and basic modules.

**2. Yifei Wu and Yuanchao Sun - Cdot Network CTO and Architect**

Cdot Network is a hub for the cross-chain transfer of crypto assets. It aims to provide a universal development framework, secure settlement guarantee, and sustainable economic incentive system, for access to the ledger.

The team planned the economic model of IPO (the first parallel chain slot auction) for the first time. Core functions is under rapid development. The testnet is expected to be launched in February next year.

**3.Qi Sun and Yang Xu -- nft transaction**

For non-fungible token exchange, the existing case is energy trading, but we hope to apply to more non-standard assets. The development of the chain has completed 60%, and when it is fully done,it will be handed over to the front-end rpc.

**4. Shuai Cao - frequent participants in hackathon**

One project is related to parking lot.

Another is Uniswap, which is an exchange protocol, similar to bancor;

There is also a demo similar to Makerdao.

**5. Jianhuai Xie-TransX at CEO**

TransX designs a layer of protocol where on-chain transactions equal to mining. And everyone is encouraged to pay with digital currency.

**6. Liang Li and Minchao Xi - CTO and Core Developer at Wookone**

Basically, they are based on the Substrate, which expands the authentication or authorization capabilities. For example, license authorization in the manufacturing chain. https://wooko.ng/en This is our website. After Kusama supports transfer function, we should update to support it soon.

(In addition, we are still trying to contribute some code for Substrate: https://github.com/wookong-dot/substrate/tree/wookong-dot-cht-hd-signer. It is about the subkey module. We use a hardware signer, an sr25519 hardware signer, which is actually quite rare (the only one actually). However, some problems have also been found. The entire Polka ecosystem has some confusion about the prepared interface for hardware wallet access. They look down on some definitions in BIP specification, which can be understood. But in the current code, it is still a bit messy if the path is derived. There is no consensus.)

**7. Zhiguang Huang- CEO at Xiamen Biteyun**

It is an enterprise DAO project that must be kept secret, because it is a technical cooperation project.

**8. Yong He - Founder and Chief Developer at DBchain**

DBchain currently has more than 20 employees, and the project has been launched for 3 months, and currently has nearly 2,000 active users.

**9.Caiyi Liang - Full stack developer at Ocal node join network**

She is currently refixing and writing documents

**10. Eric, Co-founder at ProChain**

ProChain is a precision marketing blockchain based on big data, and is currently actively exploring the possibility of Substrate-based development. In an era of application chain interconnected, since user data is scattered across application chains, on-chain advertising or rewards need to call user data on other chains via cross chain. Our project is related to decentralized digital advertising, and the official websites are 

<https://chain.pro>

<https://coinmarketcap.com/zh/currencies/prochain/>

**11.Hao Sun - Under Planning**

He hasn’t started writing codes yett. At the design stage, there will be two projects:

One group is studying the part of the contract and intends to make some Dapps;

The other group plans to use the rintime module to do a social business transaction project.

**12. Jiye Chen - Related to Architecture Design, not Yet Disclosed**

It is related to co-creation of content. Generally, the content can be spliced like Lego. Users can connect the original data content through the graph data structure to build new content. During the splicing process, the semantic relationship between the data is recorded to realize Semantic web from Tim Berner's lee. Finally, I hope to achieve a decentralized semantic web / content creation platform maintained by a community.



### 2.9. Feedback from Some Students

After the course, we have received feedback from some students on the course. The feedback is summarized as follows:

**@ Minchao Xi:** 

This course is very helpful. I am currently learning Rust while continuing to learn other demos of substrate. When using balance, I was not clear which trait should be used before, because there are many similar traits. After studying the course, I can choose them more comfortably.

**@ Hao Zhai:**

It is very helpful, for example, for the development of runtime modules. There were many templates before that I didn’t know what was going on. They can be used but I don’t understand them well. This course gave me a comprehensive understanding of the entire Substrate development.

**@ Haosong Feng:**

The low-level knowledge of a lot of chains learned is very useful, as we mainly use JS at work. I have only heard about cross-chain before. After the course, I really learned the concept and operation of cross-chain from the perspective of development. The difference from a public chain like Ethereum is still very huge. The substrate framework is really powerful for cross-chain. Hopefully the substrate documentation will be more complete.

**@ Sheng Li:**

It is still very helpful to quickly get started with the strategy. If you learn it yourself, there are many obstacles to overcome. This course can help developers save a lot of time.

**@ Nick:**

Learning Substrate is still very eye-opening. I plan to dive deeper into the blockchain myself, so it is helpful to learn something new in the blockchain field in advance.

**@ Yang Xu:**

At the moment I feel pretty good. Our investment in Polka is strategic, and this is the next generation of Ethereum. We must follow this trend.

**@ Erchuan Ma:**

I know more about Polka, and I am designing cross-chain solutions. Getting familiar with the structure of the substrate code is very helpful for blockchain development.

**@ Jianan Yi:**

A deeper understanding of the mechanism of the chain and Rust development. And I am more confident in the future development of projects based on the substrate framework. Our products support ksm and will support dot in the future.

**@ Bosong Tang:**

Knowing you guys, this is the biggest gain and help!

**@** **Caos:**

The biggest help was that I successfully joined the teaching assistant team and met a group of the best Substrate developers.

### 2.10. Course prices, income, and expenditure:

In order to increase the threshold for course registration, and in order to select developers who has development experience and motivation to complete the course to participate in the course, we charge nominal deposit fee from the students. And another reason is the cost of course production and operation is high, as our team consists of 3 operation managers and 1 designer to fulfill the needs of each session. And the tuition fee varies for each session, and students who complete all assignments on time will receive a 50% refund after the course ends. The remaining cost is used to cover the operating staff costs for each session. The detailed income and expenditure is as follows:

**The first session:**

Price: 1299 yuan / person. If the student completes all assignments on time, 650 yuan will be returned

1. Tuition Income: 44166 yuan = 34 * 1299 yuan

2. Expenditure: 25803.47 yuan

1) "Assignment Submission on Time" Reward: 11 * 650 = 7150 yuan

2) Coupon: Qi Wang 200 yuan

3) Referral Reward: 90.93 yuan

4) Bonus for Teachers: 36725.07 * 0.5 = 18362.54 yuan

3. The Net Income of OneBlock+: 36725.07 * 0.5 = 18362.54 yuan

**The Second Session:** 

Price: 1499 yuan / person, complete all assignments on time and return 750 yuan tuition

1. Tuition Income: 66804.5 yuan = 40 * 1499 + 3 * 1299 yuan (early purchase) +999 yuan (coupon) + 1948.5 yuan
2. Expenditure: 43526.85 yuan

1) "Assignment Submission on Time" Reward: 25 * 750 = 18750 yuan

2) Referral Reward: 1499.2 yuan

3) Bonus for Teachers: 46555.3 * 0.5 = 23277.65 yuan

3. The Net Income OneBlock+: 46555.3 * 0.5 = 23277.65 yuan



Due to the high tuition fees, the students in each session is not ideal. If we can obtain a grant, starting from the fourth course session, we will charge students a small deposit (e.g. 499 yuan) for future courses to ensure the quality of the students and the full cost will be refunded to everyone when all assignments are completed. We aim to help web3 build a better ecosystem of the Substrate and developer community , and to train more qualified developers.
