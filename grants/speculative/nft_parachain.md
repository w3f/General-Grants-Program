# General Grant Proposal

* **Project:** NFT Parachain

## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview

#### Brief Description

NFT Parachain is a Substrate based blockchain made for handling Non Fungible Token (NFT) collections. It includes NFT Pallet that allows creating collections of unique things, minting tokens, and managing transfers, provides ERC-721 and ERC-1155 functionality, and many more features.

The POC of NFT Chain was delivered during Hackusama hackaphon. More information is availabe in [this delivery walk-through document](https://github.com/usetech-llc/nft_parachain/blob/master/doc/hackusama_walk_through.md). The scope proposed here is about half of the overall scope for the production chain to go live, we have secured remaining financing from Usetech.

The source code for the POC is available in this repository: https://github.com/usetech-llc/nft_parachain

#### How NFT Parchain Integrates into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama

NFT Chain is based on Substrate (currently a modified version of RC4 release). The plan is to integrate into Kusama (and further in Polkadot) ecosystem as a parachain and provide NFT functionality to all parachains in the network and to any dapp creatorts that need NFTs.

#### Why Is My Team Interested

We see Polkadot as a very promissing technology that will be used for a large number of use cases. It will greatly contribute to adoption of blockchain in powerful applications. It is technically one of the most ambitious blockchain projects we know of, and we would like to be part of the community that's creating it, as well as developing on it once the network goes live.

In particular, NFT technology are a great part of our roadmap, which includes integration with Gaming frameworks, building gaming APIs, wallets, etc. NFT Tracking Module will enable next steps in this roadmap such as bridges to other networks, NFT exchange, etc. Substrate is uniquely powerful and flexible to allow a completely new generation of NFT capabilities.
