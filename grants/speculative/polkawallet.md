## Development Roadmap

### 1. Wallet infrastructure

At the stage 1, the HD wallet infrastructure will be setup, including:

* Mnemonic generation, backup and recovery
* Mnemonic to seed, then seed to private key
* Derive DOT address from private key
* UI design

### 2. Adding functionalities

* Check balance using explorer API
* Send / Receive DOT
* Check transaction history

### 3. SDK and Documentation

* At this stage, we will be providing the core wallet functionality as a separate swift framework, so that it can be reused by other app developers.
