# Planning & Organization

## A. Fundamental steps (co-founders of meetup) & Budget

i. Estrella Li and Lee Raj will be co-hosting these meetups on behalf of our company Yesbit Technologies Inc. We have hosted successful multiple meetups in the past years and are willing to promote Polkadot events to the Toronto community. Previous efforts have been made in regards to this (https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/issues/45) and we are willing to collaborate further with the organizers. 

ii. We won’t need funding to organize events for Polkadot since we have numerous event hosting experience, we can cover the cost of food and drinks for any event below 70 attendees (Organizing conference will be excluded).

iii. We use the office space as our main event venue for its capacity is at 70 people. We have hosted many kinds of events at the office before, such as panel discussion, workshop, community meetup, project pitch.


## B. Speakers & or materials needed (for presentations)

We will bring in speakers from our network consisting of thought leaders form the Toronto blockchain community, executives from blockchain companies, blockchain community meetup organizers, developers and enthusiasts. We welcome and would love to host guest speakers from polkadot, parity and web3 team as well. 

## C. Marketing & signups (what platform will you use)

For landing page, we can choose between eventbrite and meetup to put up the content and signups. Our team maintains great relationship among all blockchain community groups in Toronto, that includes Toronto based Chinese investors and crypto users. On the other hand, we promote events through digital channels such as social media, chat groups, reddit, bitcoin talk, media partners and our own maillist.


## D. Timelines & Agenda

The earliest event we can do for Polkadot, is to represent Polkadot at Canada’s biggest blockchain conference FUTURIST. We have registered as silver sponsor, and are in a close relationship with the host.

Later on, we can arrange different meetups in every month or another, depends on Polkadot needs. 


# Hosting your meetup/s

## A. Signs & materials

To be able to put up an event for Polkadot, we will need Polkadot to provide brand asset/style guide for both material design and digital graphic, so does the merchants as well. If shipment is an issue, we have local vendors who work closely with our team and offer competitive price as well. Although, our team won’t cover the merchant cost, the expense will still be guaranteed acceptable.

## B. Food & beverage

Our previous food menu have included h'orderves, capas, drinks with open bar or drink tickets. We have people who can do bartending, cater chinese food and sushi as well.


## C. A/V 

Whenever possible we will collect slides from the presentation and post it to a public Github repository or to Google drive. In case video recordings are conducted, they will be posted to platforms like YouTube. We are happy to consider decentralized alternatives :) 

## D. Available Presentation / Design assets for the community

We will consider the following as suggested by the polkadot community:

1. Polkadot template presentation 
2. Substrate template presentation
3. Any other templates as necessary
