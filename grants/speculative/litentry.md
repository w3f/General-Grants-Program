# Litentry

## Project Description
Polkadot Runtime Modules and corresponding UIs: Identity

Litentry is a second layer protocol and infrastructure based on Substrate. It focuses on Identity of person and IoT devices, and the authorization and permissions granted by the Person or IoT devices.
Details please see [our blog](https://www.litentry.com/post/litentry-introduction) and [the pitch presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-mesEZV5eoRW_dP3MZwbZPUaqNPtMoxd/view?usp=sharing) 

It mainly includes three parts:

1. Identity runtime module

2. API server

3. Identity management application

We are interested into the project since we find the crosschain function provided by Substrate is extremly powerful, thus we do not need to create a centralized server to relay the informations to different application-specific blockchain.

## Team members
Currently one full-time developer works on that.

* Hanwen Cheng

We have a few developer, I could offer their information in private.

After we have grant, we will transfer one more part-time developer into full-time.

As Jingtum's European project director last year I was in Europe to promote the blockchain solution on access control, that's also why we came up with this idea, check our [previous work](https://www.litentry.com/post/oss-meeting)
An access control parachain example could be find [here](https://video.wixstatic.com/video/760d3a_fd3919e6e8944f5d8684b7224f84675b/1080p/mp4/file.mp4)
