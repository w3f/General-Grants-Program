# Darwinia Network

## Project Description
We are building a game parachain (Darwinia Network) for Polkadot. Darwinia Network is an open, cross-chain protocol support games for cross-chain interaction in game logic and game assets. Meantime, we are developing Darwinia AppChain ,Darwinia AppChain is a set of blockchain development kits that can meet the needs of application developers for different blockchain customizations. With Darwinia AppChain ,developers can create blockchain game or dapp quickly and smoothly.

We created a multi-chain game world: Evolution Land, www.evolution.land. We will use Darwinia network for cross-chain operation for Evolution Land. EvolutionLand has been deployed and live on Ethereum and Tron, we are working to extend to EOS and PChain network in next iteration.

* The TRON continent won the $20,000 special prize in the TronAccelerator competition and was invited to attend the niTROn Summit conference.
* Partnership with Imtoken and bihu.com.
* Interstellar asset coding standard enables Cryptokitties to integrate into the Evolution Land to create an open game ecosystem (Kitties become pets in EvolutionLand).

By the way, Darwinia network already listed on Polkadot wiki in community section https://wiki.polkadot.network/en/latest/polkadot/build/examples/

## Development Roadmap

1 month: research and developement of the POC-1 Testnet. Technical functionalities for this stage:

* Research on the tokens economic and staking protocol of Darwinia Network, and finalized the design paper
* Develop several SRML modules based on Substrate, and run a public testnet.
* Develop on web wallet based on polkadot-js.
* Develop an blockchain browser for the testnet to view blocks ans transactions.

**Deliverables**:
1. A design paper introducing this project, and the technical structure of it, including token economics and staking.
2. A public Darwinia network testnet, including telemetry.
2. Web wallet interface for testing and playing with.
3. A simple blockchain browser.


2 month: Continue develop and testing with core SRML modules, including token, staking, gas model etc.

As a result, there will be a POC-2 testnet launched with this new module in the substrate runtime.

**Deliverables**: 
1. POC-2 Testnet published.
2. New functions including converting Token RING to KTON.
3. Using RING as fees and gas.
4. Adopt KTON token in the process of staking.


3 month: Polkadot bridge related functions support NFT and tokens swaping from Ethereum and TRON.

As a result, there will be a POC-3 testnet launched with with these bridge and swap features.

**Deliverables**:
1. POC-3 Testnet published.
2. Token and NFT bridging or swaping between Ethereum/TRON testnet and the POC-3 Testnet.
3. Full functional web wallet support these functions.
4. User friend blockchain browser.


After that, there could more testnet for testing and preparing mainnet launch. It is expected that the Darwinia Network mainnet will be launched at Q4 2019.

This Darwinia Network is based on Substrate and willing to connect to Polkadot finally. The grant award will be used to support the development of the project.


## Additional Information
**Tech & Ecosystem**

Darwinia Network is committed to being a parachain for Polkadot, which we are preparing for both Tech and Ecosystem.
You can check our github and homepage for tech detail

**Home**: https://darwinia.network/

**GitHub**: https://github.com/darwinia-network

Meantime, Darwinia Network design a Staking mode to build ecosystem to bid Polkadot parachain. We look forward to Polkadotâ€™s advising and support.

Community
We host a meetup about blockchain in Nanjing ,China to help build Polkadot community. Here are some photos and reference for the meetup.  We look forward to Polkadot team coming to Nanjing!
