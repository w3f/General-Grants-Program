# Project name
Plasm

## Project Description
Plasm is a Substrate Runtime Module Library which allows developers to add Plasma functions to their Substrate chain. Since we are making SRML, we can also make both plasma parent chains and plasma child chains with Substrate. We made some Plasma chains by using Plasm. We aim to be a Plasma parachain. You can see our slide deck from [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c-O0Ch-m2vX4bo4KMO5KxrDQlyDqn3Kl36gjo--5A5k/edit#slide=id.p) 

Today, there are many problems in this space like public blockchain doesn’t scale, L2 doesn’t have strong security and so on. Plasma is one of the ideal solutions. However, there are many derivfative "Plasmas" and it makes difficult for devs to understand how Plasma works. Plasm consists of both Plasma UTXO based libraries and Plasma account based libraries. It makes easier for developers to make and customize their Substrate chain and we aim to bring infinite scalability into this space. Developers can choose one of the plasma solutions from Plasm and apply it to their use case so that they can use Plasma freely and easily.

* Plasm has some features.
* Scalability is needed in the Polkadot ecosystem. Since Plasm is SRML with high versatility and expansibility, we are making a Plasma paracahin and it makes easy even for other developers to make a Plasma chain.
* We believe that blockchain is the social infrastructure. As an operating system for the next generation, we think Plasma like hierarchical/layered specification which brings high social scalability is needed.

## Development Roadmap
Please add information setting into sufficient detail the following (usually two pages):

* The specifications of the software, delivered over a number of milestones. The detail must be such that after delivery we are able to examine whether the software meets the requirements agreed in the specifications, in order to be able to make any payments to you.
* A time schedule on when each milestone will be achieved.
* The required grant per milestone and the total amount requested. Grants can be in one of the fiat currencies CHF, EUR or USD or in DOTs or a combination of fiat and DOTs. Please reach out to grants@web3.foundation for discussing what amount in fiat and DOTs would be appropriate. 
* Note that we now have a preference to collect the financial information via our Google Form, or via a Google Document (paste the link into our Google Form).


Note: It should be clear how the project will be working towards deployment on Substrate / Polkadot.

Also helpful to know: what are the team’s long-term plans and intentions after the grant has been awarded?
