# web3graph

## Project Description
`web3graph` is a graphQL reference implementation for Kusama and Polkadot network.

We plan to provide the following:
  * A graphQL reference implementation for Kusama network.
  * A graphQL reference implementation for Polkadot network.
  * A toolkit to help others within the community to be able to implement other sub-graph for their respective parachain(s), etc. etc.

## Team members

## Development Roadmap 1.0
My plan is to build and ship code with a consistent flow, current thinking is every two weeks, not too long, not too short.

My estimates for this current roadmap is USD 28,888 (50% in FIAT and 50% in DOT).

Milestones:
- M0 - 2 weeks: Gather intial OSS tool sets
- M1 - 2 weeks: Build & Ship the Proof of Concept
- M2 - 2 weeks: Incorporate feedback from community feedback
- M3 - 2 weeks: Build & Ship the Alpha version
- M4 - 2 weeks: Incorporate feedback community feedback
- M5 - 2 weeks: Run AMAs, conduct workshops on how to create a sub-graph and map out Roadmap 2.0

The github organisation and repo is currently licensed as Apache 2.0. 

The long-term plans and intentions is to continue building the `web3graph` technical toolkit, supporting documentation, and ecosystem so as to help the rest of `Polkadot`, `Substrate`, and parachains in our multi-chain universe.
