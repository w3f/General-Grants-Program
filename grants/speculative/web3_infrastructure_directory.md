# Web3 Infrastructure Directory

Creating a visual, intuitive, and fast way for people to explore and create mechanisms (starting with Substrate chains and Polkadot stuff) that deploy to Web3. This would include a directory of all the projects building stuff in the Web3 space, an standardized API that connects them all, and a drag and drop UI where you can select the modules you want to put together and receive a working protocol template that you can just open and `cargo run`. Think of it like a mix between crates.io and the TensorFlow model zoo. This would:
- make it easier for projects to build things that integrate into Web3
- make it easier to people building things on Web3 to integrate stuff that other projects built
- make it faster and more intuitive than ever for people to get started and build stuff

The Web3 Infrastructure Directory would require the buy-in from a lot of different stake holders in the space:
- Web3 grants team to fund R&D
- Substrate technical team to understand how it would/could work
- Community outreach team to create education materials/docs/tutorials

While I can dream up many proposals in my head, it's probably going to be sub optimal because I don't understand the interests and constraints of all parties involved. Currently I'm trying to better understand the various aspects of the ecosystem and how they might all fit in before proposing a concrete plan. This process could be greatly accelerated via a grant to work on it full time, but as I said the first step is just doing the research. Grants usually like concrete proposals with timelines, but this project requires input and cooperation from multiple stakeholders across the Web3 ecosystem. It would be a dream come true if this could be realized quickly, but it would require some activation energy to initiate the process. As this is a community related project, I'm submitting this application to ask if the W3F would be open to funding initial research in that direction with the goal of producing a concrete design spec.

Thanks! :)

The Web3 Infrastructure Directory will also require feedback and buy-in from:

## Team's experience
I've been talking to people in the Web3 ecosystem about this idea and have received positive sentiments of support and was encouraged to submit this project for a community grant. 


## Team Code Repos
* N/A: currently in research phase.

## Development Roadmap

1) Create a draft proposal that can be presented to stakeholders in the ecosystem.
  - 1 week

2) Engage with key stakeholders in the ecosystem to determine what would need to be modified and/or changed in the proposal to achieve buy-in and make the project a go.
  - 1-2 months

3) Write a more concrete proposal that is a direct result of input from the stake holders in the ecosystem that would be required to make the Web3 Infrastructure Directory a reality. 
  - 2 months

Ideally this would allow for a template to be build before launch of the Polkadot Network. This would mean that new projects entering the space would have clear guidelines to make their protocols and chains accessible, discover-able, and inter-operable with other projects on the network. 

After this there would be ongoing maintenance and outreach to build the UI, build docs, and perform developer outreach to make sure that the project evolves in a way that is maximally useful to all parties involved. There would be another grant request for this, or it could be put out by Web3 as an RFP. 

Considering how useful this could be, it seems like a real win for the ecosystem with minimal downside risk for the W3F.
