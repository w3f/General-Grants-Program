# Ross Bulat: Polkadot JS Development

## Project Description
I am applying for funding to continue my activities surrounding Polkadot JS development, which has for the last 6+ weeks involved intensively researching and developing around Polkadot, primarily in https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps. 

I have been working on the frontend Polkadot “apps” app for a number of weeks, providing PRs to enhance the UX of the project, as well as starting conversations on Github around specific focuses of the project. I have offered professional advice and furthered the advancement of the project on the UX front. By taking a hands-on approach to investigating UX issues, I have exposed myself to the structure of the project and how it is built.

I am currently the only developer working on the non-functional aspect of the app; styling and design language, support for responsive design to support all devices, enhacing project structure keeping it in line with cutting edge React / Typescript UX support. However, I am open to also develop functional aspects of the app where appropriate.

If end-users are to use Polkadot at scale, the front end needs to equal or better centalised solutions. Right now there is not a lot of activity pushing this forward. I have been in active discussion with Jaco Greeff on a range of app issues, and have had support from Stefanie Doll on a feedback basis to my contributions.

## Ross's experience

##### Seasoned full stack developer
Ross has been in full stack development for one-and-a-half decades, sparked by the interest of manipulating UX with ActionScript 2 and Flash. He has completed many deliverables for clients on the web ranging from PHP and MySQL solutions, to MongoDB based Python and NodeJS backend services running behind a React based front-end. He is now personally focussed on decentralised technologies, and continues to refine his UX skills by merging web3 with the front- end.

##### Active in the blockchain space
He recently attended the ETHSingapore hackathon to gain further insights into the Ethereum community and current areas of focus for the protocol in general. Ross has also extensively studied git in relation to Github, and the best methods for running a decentralised organisation. He contributes to other Ethereum based projects and publically contributes to the Uniswap project.

##### Growing online following in contemporary development
Ross has a growing online brand where he regularly posts contemporary development articles for Medium subscribers, having now amassed over 950 followers. He offers free consultations on his website to promote decentralisation in general. Originally from the UK, he is currently based in Asia, spending most of his time in Shenzhen, China and Chiang Mai, Thailand.

## Development Roadmap
Proposed duration: 3 months.

Proposed funding: $30,000, or a split between USD and DOTs with the majority of value in USD.

I would actively work on the following problems within the front end, which after the proposed 3 month timeframe would be at a high, acceptable standard. I would then like to continue supporting the project and Parity Technologies in general where opportunities present themselves.

##### Onboarding new users
The app is currently split into sections whereby the user is expected to know what they are doing, and this is a problem for newcomers to the platform. Solutions such as abstracting these sections into a Home of Dashboard section (while maintaining support for Substrate's dynamic nature) are being discussed, and could also be reflected in a more feature-rich sidebar.
I would like to continue these efforts.

##### Help Content
We have began introducing help content in the form of rollovers and tooltips, but this is just the begining of a journey of supporting the end user. I woild like to expand on this feature, as well as provide a glossary slide-out with filtering functionalities. 

Issues surrounding user-friendliness and help content are being discussed at https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/issues/900.

##### Stacked content
The UI of blocks of data need to be overhauled completely. Specialised UX for various types of hashes need to be established, as well as UX for a user's hash. In addition, adhoc UX needs to be introduced for data such as offline validator status. 

##### Forms
Forms are currently not optimised throughout the app, and are confusing to use. I have began investigating solutions to displaying inputs more coherently and supporting responsive behaviour. I envisage all form elements to be overhauled. In addition to this, full-screen designs can be introduced for isolated tasks such as making a transfer, where there should  be 2 minimal inputs on the screen, aiming for 2 - 3 max.

Validation is currently stacked in one box, which adds confusion. This, as well as the overall presentation and interaction with forms, need to be reviewed and brought in line with user expectations.

##### Miscellaneous
Moving the app in a styled-component direction to ease the management of CSS. Tidy up of structure, e.g. some styles are currently breaking expected behaviour of the app. I will also support the team to carry out misc UX enhancements and general app fixes upon request. I am open to also develop functional aspects of the app where appropriate.

## Additional Information
I have been researching the underlying protocols in the Substrate framework in a general manor, as well as Rust familiarisation, and would like to commit more time to this in the event this grant proposal is funded.

I have personal interests in experimenting with the framework and have ideas on how to apply It to real world blockchain use cases. Perhaps naïve ideas at this point, I would like to have the freedom to experiment with Substrate and write about my findings through my development blog, having now amassed over 1,000 followers and growing on a daily basis.

My Medium following is based around a contemporary development brand primarily focussed on React, blockchain and decentralised apps in general. I am also leading a publication, being built from the ground up, based around Blockchain development, aiming to provide hands-on walkthroughs for interested parties to start using the technology. I envisage the publication to be primarily Ethereum and Substrate / Polkadot focussed. The publication articles will need to be premium Medium content unless funding is provided; I would ideally like to offer this content for free to speed up the adoption and general public knowledge of blockchains. The publication now has its first article around MakerDAO, and can be found at The Block Journal on Medium.
