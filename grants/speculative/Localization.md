# Localization of Substrate Support Documentation and Substrate Collectibles Workshop 

## Project Description
The project is aimed at localizing existing Substrate support documentation (https://docs.substrate.dev/docs) and Substrate Collectibles Workshop (https://shawntabrizi.github.io/substrate-collectables-workshop/#/) into several languages that we believe are crucial to the growth of the number of Substrate and Polkadot supporters, which will help to reach developers in many countries with strong developer communities. It will also assist in setting up localization processes and workflows that can be used for future localization needs.
According to Hackerrank [1], China and Russia are the top two countries with the most skilled developers in the world, yet Russia is only No 42 on the English Proficiency Index (moderate proficiency), while China is 47 (low proficiency) [2]. Among the countries that have highly qualified software development specialists amid moderate to low English proficiency are also Japan, Taiwan, France, Italy, Ukraine, Spain, South Korea and Vietnam.
Therefore, we propose to localize the documentation into Chinese, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Vietnamese. These translations not only will help to reach communities in the above countries, but will also attract interest in other regions (e.g. Russian is spoken in most CIS countries, Spanish in South America, French in Africa, etc).

Currently, the follwoing models are used for localization purposes:

Model 1
In-house. Dedicated linguists are based on the client's or localization vendor premises.
Pros: Highest quality
Cons: Highest cost

Model 2
Outsorcing from a single vendor. Localization services are procured from a language service provider.
Pros: Relatively high quality. Low level of admnistrative efforts required from client.
Cons: High cost. Vendors often subcontact work to other vendors.

Model 3
Outsorcing from multiple vendors. Localization services are procured from several individual transators.
Pros: High quality. Hand-picked vendors specialized in the required domain. Relatively low cost (client pays for the actual cost of the service).
Cons: Requires management from the client side.

Model 4
Machine translation post-editing. Content is machine-translated and then edited by specially trained linguists. The latter part may be implemented both via in-house or outsourcing model.
Pros: Provides the ability to localize high quantities of content in relatively small timeframe. Cost-effective compared to regular localization.
Cons: Requires significant investment in machine learning infrastructure and setting up processes. Suitable only for repetitive technical content.

Model 4
Crowdsourced translations. Localization services are provided by volunteers.
Pros: Low cost. Community involvement.
Cons: Average to low quality. Inconsistency. High turnout rate of volunteers. Mostly non-professional localization.

For this project we propose to outsorce localization from multiple vendors (Model 3). In order to ensure coordination and management of resources, the lead applicant is willing to provide localization project management service pro bono during initial stage, until larger-scale involvement is required.


## Team members
Team Lead and Project Manager: Yevgen Chygrynskyy
Localization vendors: 16 members to be selected
	

## Legal Structure 
Team Lead is self-employed. The legal status of the rest of the tema is TBC.


## Team's experience
Yevgen has over 10 years in game and software localization in in-house and remote settings, which includes translation, editing, content creation, LQA testing, trainings, team leading and project management. He has background in translation, law and international relations and has experience running small teams and managing budgets of up to 100k USD.

He has been a blockchain enthusiast since 2017 and been running a handful of nodes for a couple of projects (including Polkadot) and hobby-mining a few cryptocurrencies. He also has been assisting such projects as AKASHA, Origin Protocol and Bisq with their localization needs.

## Development Roadmap
According to analysis by Inspider Insite tool, the current total wordcount for Substrate documentation hub is 17,664 words and 14,538 for Substrate Collectibles Workshop (as of 19 March 2019). The current weighed word count is 27,995. We expect the number to be lower due to numerous non-translatables in the text which will need to be excluded from the total wordcount.

The project can realistically be implemented in 4 months. It will require a part-to-full time dedication of one localization project manager and part-time dedication from 8 translators and 8 reviewers (one per language). Please note that the calculation is based on the highest average per-word and hourly rate for translation and review for each language and is likely to be about 30% lower. The detailed budget can be found in the Google Form.

Milestones
-	Creation of Terms of References, survey and test for vendors; publication of vacancy notice (weeks 0-2);
-	Creation of a template for Style Guides and Term Base (weeks 2-4);
-	Setting up CAT-tools and preparation of translatables (week 5);
-	Selection of vendors, setting up communication channels (weeks 6-7);
-	Creation of Style Guides and Term Bases for each language (weeks 8-9);
-	Translation of Substrate support documentation (weeks 10-11);
-	Review of Substrate support documentation, translation of Substrate Collectibles Workshop (weeks 12-13);
-	Review of Substrate Collectibles Workshop; implementation of queries; summing-up results (weeks 14-15).

Ideally, we could receive the first installment of the grant before the start of week 5 in order to cover expenses for setting up CAT-tool (Transifex or similar) and job board (Proz.com) subscriptions. The rest of the installments could be paid on a monthly basis. The Project Manager is willing to provide their services on the pro bono basis for the first 5 weeks until a larger-scale involvement is required.
The Project Manager is willing to consider partial payment of up to 50% in DOTs. The rest of the team will be offered to consider partial payment in DOTs as well.


## Expected Results
1.	Creation of glossaries, localization style guides and vendor terms of references.
2.	Setting up localization tools as well as SOP regarding their use.
3.	Creation and maintaining communication support channel (Riot or Slack) to keep localization vendors involved.
4.	Fully localized Substrate support documentation into Chinese, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Vietnamese.
5.  Higher involvement of developer community in the countries with the above langagues spoken. 
6. The results above will also serve as a foundation for future localization projects. It will be possible to deploy localization teams much faster and localize necessary containe in much smaller timeframes.
