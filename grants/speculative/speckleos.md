# Speckle OS

## Project Description

We are building a universal user interface for Polkadot, Substrate and Web 3. This involves three parts:
1.	Speckle Browser: a front-end browser specialized for a web of connected chains;
2.	Speckle Parachain: a back-end parachain that handles identity, account management and communication; and
3.	Speckle Box: the speckle-ui framework for substrate-based chains.
The front-end that acts as a universal user interface for Polkadot and its parachains. This closest similarity would be Metamask and Status; however, a user interface for a connected web of chains requires significant innovation to the user experience as opposed to an interface for a single chain. As part of this innovation, we will be deploying a parachain back-end to handle account management, identity and communication across the Polkadot Network. Further, this will be repurposed into a general UI framework for substrate-based chains. This will allow substrate chains to quickly deploy their own UI and modify its feature-set to suit their consensus and governance modules.

## Development Roadmap
* MVP Desktop Application/Browser Extension (3 months of work)

1. R&D and Planning for POC 3.0, UI Design and Project Setup (2 weeks)

Research and planning for the upcoming POC-3 to determine additional features required and amendments to our workflow. In parallel, we will design the user interface and workflow outlines for the feature-sets that connect to the test-net.

2. Account Management (2 weeks)
Setup account creation, compatibility with Parity Signer, account management, key generation, local browser storage and key encryption

3. Asset Dashboard (1 week)
Setup real-time viewing of assets (requires connection to testnet). Initially, this will be DOTs for the MVP – later scale to native assets on parachains closer to Polkadot’s release.

4. Transaction Management (2 weeks)
Facilitate send/receive functions, as well as a viewing of transaction history.

5. Governance Participation (3 weeks)
Allow users to view, vote and stake for validators, as well as on-chain governance upgrades.

6. Message Signing (1 week)
Allow users to sign messages to interact with dApps on the Polkadot Network.

7. Chain switching and curation framework (1 week)
A simple framework for parachain switching and curation, which will be as functional as the POC permits. It will be iteratively upgraded in lock-step with POC releases in Milestone 3.

##Future Plans
The Speckle Browser is the first component of the Speckle Universal Interface, and serves as the MVP for connecting to the Polkadot Network. Extended features for the next step of development will include fully-functional parachain switching, universal account management via the Speckle Parachain, full mobile integration, and self-contained light-clients within the Speckle Browser.
