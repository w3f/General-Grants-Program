# Polkadot/Substrate Java API

## Project Description

- Our team will develop the Polkadot/Substrate Java API.Java APIs around Polkadot and any Substrate-based chain RPC calls. It is dynamically generated based on what the Substrate runtime provides in terms of metadata. 
- Java has the largest number of programmers in the world, with a wide range of applications. Most companies use Java as the front-end back-end programming language. The biggest advantage of Java is its large and complete ecosystem.
- Our team is optimistic about the future ecology of Polkadot/Substrate, and Polkadot/Substrate brings new technologies and new opportunities for the blockchain 3.0 era, paving the way for us to develop an application-level ecosystem in the future.

## Development Roadmap

- 2019.03.10-2014.04.011

  Our team analyzes Polkadot/Substrate and combines the JavaScript API to design the best way to implement in the Java programming language. During this time, part of the Java code, a runable Jar package, and the basic Polkadot/Substra Java API functionality will be implemented on GitHub.  
  The specific functions of the API are as follows:  
  A.JSON-RPC, specifically includingAuthoring of network items,Retrieval of chain data,Query of state,Methods to retrieve system info.  
  B.balances, session, demoracacy, staking, consensus and other functions corresponding to Storage, Extrinsics, Events.  
  C.timestamp function corresponding to Storage, Extrinsics.  
  D.type, including Primitive types, Substrate types, Codec types, RPC types, Derived types.  

- 2019.04.12-2019.05.11

  Implement the existing Polkadot/Substra API in the Java programming language. During the period, submit Java code on GitHub, and a runable Jar package. Implement some API documentation with Gitbook.  
  The specific functions of the API are as follows:  
  A.council, councilMotions, councilVoting, grandpa, sudo, treasury and other functions corresponding to Storage, Extrinsics, Events.  
  B.some API examples, including Simple Connect, Listen to new blocks, Listen to balance changes, Unsubscribe from listening to updates,  Read storage, Make a simple transfer, Traverse events.  

- 2019.05.12-2019.06.11

  Submit all Java code on GitHub, a runable Jar package, implement all API documentation with Gitbook, build a Polkadot/Substra Java API official website, open Twitter, and set up a technical exchange group to promote the Polkadot/Substra Java API. If it goes well and has plenty of time, with a deep understanding of Polkadot/Substrate, we will expand the team to develop the Java client for Polkadot/substrate.
