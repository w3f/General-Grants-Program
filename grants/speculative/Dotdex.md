# Dotdex

## Project Description

We are a team that focuses on building the future of finance via innovative and decentralized solutions.

We have successful experiences of building DEX on Ethereum, EOS, TRON.

And now we decided to try something in the Polkadot ecosystem.

Our first project on Polkadot will be a Decentralized exchange named Dotdex.

## Development Roadmap

### Milestone 1 — Implement Substrate Runtime Modules — 1 month 

We will create a Substrate module that support assets trading:
  
* issue tokens
* transfer tokens
* buy and sell tokens
* create trade pair
* create limit order
* cancel limit order

We will deliver a working module, along with a simple tutorial that explains how a user can spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works.

### Milestone 2 — Implement Exchange UI and Backend Api Server — 1 month 

We will parse blockchain events and store data into database.

Provide api for looking up data of trading history. 

And we will create nice trading experience for users, just like we used to be:

### Milestone 3 — Implement multi-chain, cross-chain Trading — 1~n month 

Since Polkadot is a network protocol that allows arbitrary data—not just tokens—to be transferred across blockchains.

Dotdex will follow the new feature of Polkadot network.

Support more assets of other chains as soon as possible. 

Dotdex is born for decentralized trading, which will explore new form of decentralized trading extensively in the future, create better trading experience for users, and strive to become the infrastructure of blockchain industry.
